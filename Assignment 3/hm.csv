worldnews,,H&M accused of ‘greenwashing’ over plans to make clothes from sustainable fabric - ‘Fashion this fast can never and will never be sustainable’,,2020,"Companies make products for you. You consume them. If you want there to be less waste in the world then consume less. Shaming H&M for trying to make a move, even if it is pure marketing, is absurd.  


""Greenwashing"" among companys maybe is becoming a trend now, but ""greenwashing""  among individuals account for almost all of those concerned about the climate."

worldnews,,H&M accused of ‘greenwashing’ over plans to make clothes from sustainable fabric - ‘Fashion this fast can never and will never be sustainable’,,2020,"Many people just psychologically don't want to wear clothes someone else has worn if they have the option. So the green ideal of everyone shopping at the vintage shop is unlikely to catch on.

Good can't be the enemy of the great. Environmentalists insisting on this narrative and acting to thwart nuclear power taking up more of power generation capacity over the past few decades is the most salient example of environmentalism purity causing far more damage than good."

worldnews,,H&M accused of ‘greenwashing’ over plans to make clothes from sustainable fabric - ‘Fashion this fast can never and will never be sustainable’,,2020,"My H&M purchases have been quite long lasting, warm, classic looking, well designed etc. 

Definitely not the cliche of cheap flashy stuff I want to later throw away. 

I’d take H&M pants over Levi’s, say, any day."
worldnews,,H&M accused of ‘greenwashing’ over plans to make clothes from sustainable fabric - ‘Fashion this fast can never and will never be sustainable’,,2020,"this article is stupid. it argues that the fabric h&m plans on using is good, but criticises the maker of the fabric for selling to a company that has high volume, with the logic that we need to slow down production of clothing to reach sustainability.

youre not going to slowdown production without slowing down demand, and if you want to change demand, you need to change the behavior of people.

h&m is a clothing company. it is not on them to convince people to spend less on clothing, in fact they'd be the last company you would go to to do such a thing. as far as what a clothing company IS capable of doing, selling greener fabrics is a great way to move forward.

and if you want to reach that zero level, you need to convince the world to be lest consumerist and less materialistic. no clothing company is capable of doing that."
worldnews,,H&M accused of ‘greenwashing’ over plans to make clothes from sustainable fabric - ‘Fashion this fast can never and will never be sustainable’,,2020,"The fashion industry isn't sustainable anyway, nobody needs a whole new wardrobe every season, period."
worldnews,,H&M accused of ‘greenwashing’ over plans to make clothes from sustainable fabric - ‘Fashion this fast can never and will never be sustainable’,,2020,"After reading the article, I can conclude that this is stupid. You're mad at the company for trying to be more sustainable and changing their fabric material (something you're are supposedly in favor of). I understand greenwashing is real, but you get mad at people for not being sustainable and then when they try, you accuse them. The article also talks about customer behavior but a business gotta sell. We should welcome new ideas and sustainable practices instead of complaining. I personally still wouldn't buy from h&m as it's quite expensive for me, but I respect them for trying. It's not like they are lying about using the material. To me, greenwashing or stuff of the sort don't really matter unless the business lied in order to attract customers."
worldnews,,H&M accused of ‘greenwashing’ over plans to make clothes from sustainable fabric - ‘Fashion this fast can never and will never be sustainable’,,2020,"I'm really bored so I'll add my observations:

1. Fast fashion is slowing down, nothing will change the trend. What used to be high volume orders are now 1200pc/style - for mid range brands. Low end stuff like AE is dying, and it's still supported by Wall Street which results in high volume crap quality orders = waste.

2. Viscose is synthetic crap texture, it's generally used in to low range quality goods. If you want to be environmental friendly it shouldn't even be produced in the first place. There are good uses for synthetics like water absorption clothes, but people dispose them even though they can be reused a number of times.

3. Organic cotton is a fraud, you can use it as a marketing term or say cottons are farmed with better biodynamics. No one in the production industry buys organic yarn. Hence you don't see high end brands using ""organic"" cotton. Cotton is is technically super advanced with a high range of  treatment and the range of textures is superior for many different types of uses. You can consider recycle cotton or find a way to dispose of it environmentally instead of wasting resources to produce more synthetics but cost would be higher than generally accepted.

worldnews,,H&M accused of ‘greenwashing’ over plans to make clothes from sustainable fabric - ‘Fashion this fast can never and will never be sustainable’,,2020,"What do you mean? I understand they have a fast fashion strategy but so do other brands, including luxury brands. Not to mention that most luxury brands don’t even discount their old collection, they simply destroy it... consumers should become more sustainable by recycling and not buying clothes every day"
worldnews,,H&M accused of ‘greenwashing’ over plans to make clothes from sustainable fabric - ‘Fashion this fast can never and will never be sustainable’,,2020,"On one hand I do agree that we, as a society, should not be this wasteful for what we wear.

But on the other hand, I think that maybe we are looking at this problem in the wrong way. I dont totally know or understand clothing recycling, so maybe I shouldn't speak on it. But I will anyway. Why don't we find a way to more effectively recycle clothing and work on that? Companies could make money, consumers could buy ""new"" clothing items with less guilt, and I think that even the environment would benefit. Along with this, we could find a more eco-friendly way of producing the clothing.

I understand the solution I pose is not a simple nor easy one to get to, but I think that the idea is a good start."

Their clothes are such bad quality. And the thing that annoys me the most is that I live in a tropical region and in winter they still sell mainly only clothes suitable for a European/Russian winter (fur coats and massive puffy jackets). We don’t even wear jumpers or cardigans here in winter!

> Garment workers making clothes for international brands in Karnataka, a major clothing production hub in India, say their children are going hungry as factories refuse to pay the legal minimum wage in what is claimed to be the biggest wage theft to ever hit the fashion industry.

> Scott Nova, executive director of the WRC, said: &quot;In terms of number of workers affected and total money stolen, this is the most egregious act of wage theft we&#039;ve ever seen. The children of garment workers are going hungry so brands can make a buck.""

> &quot;It has been almost two years since apparel suppliers have been refusing to pay the legal minimum wage and brands have been letting this continue when they know they are the only ones with the power to stop this widespread wage theft,&quot; he said.

RoleReversal,Real Life,Highstreet fashion juggernaut H&M and gender non conformity [explanation in comments],,2022,"OK, to address a few caveats right off the bat, I am aware that:  

* The women's ""power suit"" is nothing new  
* Comercialisation of strong women and gender defiance is nothing new either  
* H&M are ethically dubious, as are most fashion retaillers  

Negativity aside, there's something about this that just hits right for me. OK it's not hunky mechanic woman with greasy calloused hands, but it's a FAR cry from the eggshell facade of empowerment that is normally comercialised. *""Hey can you do a booty pose, but like...pull a grrrr face? OK now wear a skin-tight leotard but like...put your hands on your hips or some shit?""*\*   

The lack of any bold makeup making the concession ""OK, but she's like...pretty too"". Her body language is both closed off and occupies the space. Her hair is long, sure, but brushed back out of the way. Despite the visible decolletage the suit is boxy and unfrivolous. The staging and photography style is more Bauhaus than boudoir.  

Is it flawless or a style I particularly love? No.   
Is it a welcome break from the usual prissiness of women's fashion behemoths? ABSOLUTELY.

She's sat on the chair. No you can't sit next to her.    
She's wearing her suit. No it doesn't have a cinched waist or bust-accentuating darts or a sponsored-by-Alphalete booty scrunch.

Just because something isn’t explicitly for “men” or “women” doesn’t mean it has to be boring as sin,,2023,"> But a better solution is doing away with categories altogether by designing clothes that fit a variety of bodies rather than imposing a third “gender-neutral” categorization on consumers.

This may be a positive goal, but I think we need to acknowledge what a tall order this is. Think about the plus size market as a start - you can't just make straight sizes bigger, because proportions of people in larger bodies are usually different than straight-size individuals. And larger-bodied people can have different proportions compared to one another. It takes a lot of consideration and research (not to mention fit models), and companies that truly cater well to the plus market are relatively few even today.

I expect it would be similar if a brand tried to create a line for non-binary people that matches the description above, and it might be even more challenging. Non-binary people not only have a very wide variety of body types which vary in many diverse ways from current categories, but also a wide range of preferences in their gender expression - a ""non-gendered"" line would have to have incredible variety to truly cater to more than a fraction of non-binary people."

Just because something isn’t explicitly for “men” or “women” doesn’t mean it has to be boring as sin,,2023,"Nonbinary person here. All gender neutral fashion is nonsense. 

Clothing is labeled and sold as “men’s” and “women’s” because it is designed for two big categories of body type (no boobs vs boobs, taller vs shorter, etc). There is obviously a huge amount of variation within those two categories; mass produced clothing will never fit everyone’s body right. 

Nonbinary people—unlike cis men and cis women—do not have a single general body type. Some have huge boobs, some have zero boobs. Height and build can vary wildly. Making a separate clothing category for them (us) is foolishness, because there is nothing to build on, because **”gender-neutral” is not a coherent third sex or gender.** By its nature, by definition, it’s a term for people who do NOT fit into a single category. The result is that all gender neutral clothing lines are intentionally ill fitting clothes geared towards an aesthetic, not a body type, which is not a practical way to organize clothing. 

Anyway, the solution is 1) for everyone to know their own body and which categor(ies) of clothes fit them best, eg. Men’s pants and shirts are great on me but I need a bra which is a Women’s item. This all means nothing, and 2) continuing efforts to make mass produced clothing fit more body types better (eg. tall people who wear women’s jeans 😭, etc).

That’s it. Thank you for coming to my TED talk."

The thing you throw on over nothing else because it reduces you to a shapeless blob, an impenetrable mass devoid of emotion, shape, or gender? That’s the dysphoria hoodie, something that hides your body and gender expression from wandering—and potentially misunderstanding—eyes.
> 
> It’s an item born more for function than fashion, one that lacks any room for personal style or expression. Yet it’s been adopted en masse by mainstream brands looking to appeal to gender-ambiguous shoppers. Look at the “gender-neutral” lines of mainstream mall brands like Old Navy, Roots, and H&M and you’ll find a lot of dysphoria hoodies—items meant to affirm but seemingly designed to avoid any sense of silhouette, pattern, or colour. Based off the offerings of most mainstream apparel brands, you’d think “gender-free” was synonymous with no fun—ironic considering many of us who identify outside the gender binary often present ourselves in fruity and extra ways. Last year, a set of button-ups from Old Navy were shared on Twitter (now X) among transmasculine folks, and one of the shirts had a vibrant orange print—and I do mean orange as in the fruit.
> 
> For the bottom line of these brands, launching so-called “gender-neutral” lines of hoodies and sweatpants makes sense. A 2022 Unidays survey found that 65 percent of Gen Z respondents believe brands should provide gender-neutral clothing. Non-binary and trans folks are another market to target, as are cis people looking for fits or styles outside of traditionally “gendered” silhouettes, and mass-producing shapeless fabric blobs is easy enough. But it also means pretty much every other clothing item—jeans, dresses, shirts, pants, and more—remains in the clutches of the gender binary.

> As a non-binary person, I find it unfortunate to see the only clothes marketed to me come from the haute couture dysphoria hoodie line.

Just because something isn’t explicitly for “men” or “women” doesn’t mean it has to be boring as sin.

The same goes for ""feminine"" or ""girly"" styles that usually included things like pink, flowers, ribbons, dresses, etc..

Clothing that was explicitly marketed to women (Urbane brand scrubs were so popular in the early 2000’s) generally ran smaller and had deeper v necks and the tops usually nipped in at the waist, pants were cut to have some shape in the hips.

It just hammers home the idea that when you think of a person, literally just a human form, male is the default. There’s no reason why it could not have been the other way around.

Being fashionable used to be a luxury thing and only people who has money to afford it ( aka go to tailor or atelier. and now, everyone want to be fashionable and that why many corporate companies begin to make ""fast fashion"" for everyone.

It is NOT hypocrite if you wear Zara or H&m or Shein or any fast fashion alone. But if you try to be INTELLECTUAL LEFTISTS and talk about saving planets or equality when wearing a $3 Shein t-shirt, then you ARE hypocrite. Simple example is if you eat meat, don't speak about animal cruelty. It is weird to say that my generation is more liberal but at the same time, we are just as bad as overall consuming costumers.

But unfortunately the accessible high street stores are all fast fashion, including superstores, etc. Not saying that standard fast fashion is better, or that I look at what people bought by companies advertising on their own clothes.

By cutting costs in making ""fashionable"" often and cheaply, including all fast fashion and ultra-fast fashion like shein/temu, they reduce costs by making worse to awful quality clothes, that last waay shorter, so you replace them more often, costing you more money overall.

Not to mention the extremely high carbon impact and bad business, creating an industry of getting customers to buy more for the sake of it """"it was cheap"""". Fashion is designed to make you think older items are bad and need to be replaced. When they run out this is when they loop back to old designs.

Higher quality clothes cost more because they are made properly, with good materials, and human decency. But higher quality materials and stitching mean they can last much longer."

books,,Discuss: Is TikTok Is Turning Books Into Fast Fashion?,,2023,"I don’t think it’s so much tiktok as it is the publishing industry that exploits the hype of BookTok. 

Like the upcoming Sarah J Maas release that has 5 different editions with special chapters in each, incentivizing people to buy all 5 copies that 10 years down the road will probably end up in the landfill. 

The recent Red Tower release and the massive amount of misprints that are leading people to exchange books (fair enough), which means they have to reprint and ship out more books because they rushed it to capitalize on the hype. AND I just saw that they are planning on releasing a holiday edition of Iron Flame that just came out two days ago. 

So many special edition covers that get released and improperly packaged then arrive to the consumer slightly damaged and are then exchanged for pristine copies. 

I don’t begrudge people for wanting perfect copies of books when they are spending up to $100 on them, but I do wonder what is done with the slightly damaged copies and the environmental impact the publishing industry is having. 

TLDR; overconsumption is a problem and the publishing industry isn’t exempt from it.

Anticonsumption,Discussion,Hyperconsumption is the issue,"Regarding fast fashion, I've seen people criticised here for buying anything at all from H&M etc.

I don't think it's a big issue to buy from any place really as an individual, even Amazon or Walmart. 

The issue is buying too much. (Or rather producing too much because enough of it can be sold.)

If people bought H&M clothes when needed, wore them as long as possible and replace them when unwearable, H&M would have to drastically reduce its production. It wouldn't be perfect of course. Pollution and labour exploitation would still need to be addressed, and the clothes should be higher quality ideally.

A friend of mine gave me a bunch of clothes from fast fashion brands as hand-me-downs and I wear those clothes weekly. They’re my main professional clothes. I wash them on the gentle cycle and hang them to dry, and there’s been no deterioration. 

Of course I wouldn’t buy from them myself because I prefer to purchase things made from more sustainable materials. But re-using someone else’s old clothes is even better than purchasing new, more sustainable clothing. 

It just makes me wonder how many clothing items get thrown out because they’re truly unwearable and unrepairable, and how much get thrown out because people want to be on trend."

The quality of the clothing sold has gone way down even in formerly ‘good’  clothes which doesn’t help, it is very distressing to attempt to buy a quality shirt and pay for it thinking it will last years only to discover the threads coming out after a few washes. It’s discouraging. I honestly wish I had not donated so much of my clothes 20 years ago, they would fit again and also be back in style and were far better constructed. 
I wore my winter coat until it was no longer waterproof, wind proof, or even warm. I have to trash it because I would feel guilty donating it to someone who needs a warm coat, knowing that it is not. I hunted around and decided on a coat that has a very good reputation and has for my entire life, was able to get a good price on it and yet when it arrived and I put it on I noticed immediately that there was a manufacturer defect that limited all movement of one arm. I looked up the warranty but I would have to mail it in wait 8 weeks minimum and then wait for it to be mailed back, which brings us to spring and I need the coat now. I can sew so I fixed it myself by access through a pocket and now it is perfect but not everybody can or is willing to do that- a lot of people would either trash the coat, return it to be trashed, or send it for repair and buy another to wear until it comes back."

Every individual should do their best within their means and comfort with as much thought, energy and money as you are comfortable putting into the process. There are some habits we can all do easily, like avoiding polyester shirts because they stink after a few hours of wear, or choosing comfortable clothes that can double as pajamas to reduce your laundry/increase wear per garment between washing.

Remember always, capitalism does not produce clothing to clothe people, nor does it produce food to feed people, nor cars for transportation. Capitalism *only* produces to create *profit.* 

If shitty clothes produced by wage slaves and children in runs of tens of millions to be sold or not and then thrown away into the Atacama is what is needed to produce a profit; if starvation is what is needed to produce a profit; if backward ass thinking Earth destroying completely not helpful and will make climate change infinitely worse EVs continuing the 6th extinction of the planet’s biodiversity is required to produce a profit; THEN THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT CAPITALISM WILL PRODUCE.

If capitalism produced some durable goods or clothes that last more than a season, it is not because capitalism or the producers cared about the quality of their goods. It is because they only care about the sellable nature of the goods which, through induced demand and the indoctrinated conditioning of ubiquitous brain-washing advertising and mind control, has almost nothing to do with the goods themselves but about the induced demand from supply-side capitalists. 

Capitalism is nothing but a method of over-production. The *only* way to stop the juggernaut of greed is to fight capitalism tooth and nail from the systemic side. Capitalism cannot be reformed, nor is it capable of being self-critical or producing rational outcomes. Capitalism is madness, and anyone who would defend it is either deluded, mutated by greed, or is mad themselves.

Asking why capitalists don’t produce durable reparable and quality goods isn’t the path. Even if capitalists make something good once, it’ll be planned obsolescence by the time you can afford it anyway.

There is only one path to humanity producing the goods and services it needs to survive and thrive, and more than any other made up classist lie threatening our perceptions of privilege, it is the one thing which threatens and scares capitalists and their genocidal planet killing world-order: organized worker ownership and control over the workplace and means of production. That is the only way.

Rather, it is quite literally the constant push of more and more clothing releases. I would assume the only reason most Teddy Fresh customers don’t have a significant amount of items is because of the high price tag, rather than the company not being “fast fashion.” Fast fashion is the concept of companies persistently pushing new things in customers’ faces, persuading them they need to catch up on a new style, and with only a limited amount of closet space, people will ultimately donate or throw out “outdated” clothes. Unfortunately, the vast majority of apparel donated to charities or thrift stores still do end up in landfills. I would love to some how get in touch with the company and discuss environmental sustainable practices and solutions if they are interested on how they can stray away from fast fashion."

also how long they’re working on it is great and all but if it’s a drop every month, you’re still creating a full line for every month … it’s just offset, there’s no logic there.

there’s better less deflective ways to defend TF"

i've been watching h3 since they were still in Israel and there isn't a podcast episode i've skipped, though i've skipped segments hosting people i dont care to see. I've never bought a single Teddy Fresh product, but i felt the quality in person back when they were still sold at Zumiez. There have been things i've wanted, but they sold out really quickly. 

From what i can understand without really knowing the management structure and HR practices of the company, i can only assume the company is a good one to work for, though what really matters to me is how the clothes feels, looks, fits, and it's price. the moral standards behind the company is beyond me and i couldn't be fucked and/or sucked to look into every company who gets my dollar.

that being said...;

i had to google the definition of ""fast fashion"", and i just have to say... what the hell does Ethan or Hila know or care about Magic: The Gathering? That collab came out of left fucking field, because Ethan and Hila has never, ever talked about MTG from my *YEARS* of watching them. It looks like the cards they picked were picked just because they looked cool. 

[Earl Of Squirrel](https://teddyfresh.com/products/tf-x-magic-the-gathering-earl-of-squirrel-tee) is cool looking card, it's a neat little character for people who dont know MTG, but it's basically a meme with how useless it is. also, it just looks like it was a shirt bought at walmart, with how it's literally just [the card art](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/154762/magic-the-gathering-launch-party-and-release-event-promos-earl-of-squirrel-draft-weekend?country=US&utm_campaign=18142757028&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=&utm_term=&adgroupid=&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAyKurBhD5ARIsALamXaGYBpOOqn4ISKHs00QxQBEEjbPT7Bqv-YrM1EDGzvmEbaE2w14MZQ8aAl4TEALw_wcB&Language=English) transferred to a shirt. 

[Reanimate](https://teddyfresh.com/products/tf-x-magic-the-gathering-reanimate-sweatshirt) sweatshirt is a cool art style, but i guess you can really thank Robert Bliss for that, the person who designed the card art. the sweatshirt is so bland and the text looks like it was randomly pasted on. whoever was responsible for that really just [dulled down the card art](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/5684/magic-the-gathering-tempest-reanimate?country=US&utm_campaign=18142757028&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=&utm_term=&adgroupid=&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAyKurBhD5ARIsALamXaHex5XnJxaRPP0uPfiJu-FlK_qOsqGFCHFYw8Ce91ws59Bu8JEbCWIaAq-6EALw_wcB&Language=English) and put the most basic references of it on a sweatshirt

who in the hell wants to wear [Serendib Efreet](https://teddyfresh.com/products/tf-x-magic-the-gathering-serendib-efreet-tee) merch? it's a [shit card](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/118737/magic-eternal-masters-serendib-efreet?xid=pi57b5781f-b6ac-4e43-8fe6-6a5bad608da8&Language=English&page=1). magic players dont care about the card, random people who dont play magic dont care about the card. who is this for? this is for magic players who'd wear it ironically or people who're admitting with a bullhorn that they're posers.

how about some cards from the Mox Set? easy bangers there, especially with TF style they used for the collab. Chrome Mox, Mox Diamond... but lets say MTG said ""only do cards that were still modern and currently printed"" ( i know that wasn't the case with the 1997 Tempest: Reanimate, but..) how about do clothes for Commander sets, modern sets, standard sets and get the most iconic art from those sets. even the basic lands would look great. Everyone likes and plays Soul Ring, there's a lot of creative opportunity there. and Unsets? The quality in clothes is probably ok and the designs dont look bad, but this MTG collab didn't have any input from actual MTG fans. To be fair to Teddy Fresh, there isn't a lot of other options for official MTG merch that are on good quality clothes. after searching what ""fast fashion"" meant, this almost fits the bill, with how lazy the designs felt, with how the card art was copy-pasted on some clothes or blown up to cover the shirt. all they had to do is ask some genuine magic fans/players about which cards to use, assuming wizards of the coast let them have that creative liberty. 

this isn't a gatekeep. as someone else said (about literally the same topic), ""im not a hater. I'm 'booing' because i *want* to cheer"". they almost had a customer out of me because of that collab, but for that price they charge, they need to work harder on the designs.

The problem is fast fashion brands pump out new collections every couple of weeks. And thats bad for the environment.

TF definitely pumps out more collections than luxury brands who generally have only 2 per year: Fall/Winter & Spring/summer. TF does lots different collaborations, remakes of their old collections and other collections on top of the seasonal collections. So in this sense, yes TF is a fast fashion brand. 

TF should be compared more to Zara, or H&M. Quality clothes, but they also do lots of different collections per year and are considered “fast fashion”

EDIT: Seems like people are not applying logic to what I wrote and are focusing on E-E times and that quality is better than H&M/ Zara. The environmental problem is with how many collections they are dropping, which is also one of the staples of fast fashion (lots of drops throughout the year). Instead of buying clothes only through their Summer or Winter drop, like high-end brands do, you end up buying clothes from 8-10 collections per year. More collections = more clothes in the landfill"

h3h3productions,,Regarding TF being “fast fashion”,"I’m frustrated to hear people still attacking Hila for Teddy Fresh being fast fashion. I started watching about three years ago and started buying clothes from them as well at that time. I probably have a total of maybe ten-ish pieces from Teddy Fresh from multiple different collections.  This isn’t me being biased by saying this, this is me doubling down on its quality. While the price may sometimes be on the more expensive side, the pieces I’ve managed to afford are high quality and sturdy as HELL.

My acid trip hoodie looks splotchy, and my camo hoodie has splotches too after only washing them. My color block seemed to hold up fine though. Also I usually wear medium/large and a large t shirt I bought just barely fits me. It shrunk so much after washing. Now it’s really wide and short."

I respect Ethan and Hila both as people but this is hype beast nonsense. Is it fast fashion though? I don't think so but they also aren't far off. They're doing it for themselves and their investors. Neither you or them needs to defend it. If they want to cash grab in front of people they should eat the heat and move on. You're making no graces with your progressive crowd, which they chose to embrace, regardless of what you say when you act like a blatant capitalist. It's that simple. No whitewashing from you or them will change the reality of two super wealthy people trying to become more wealthy for the benefit of themselves and their ethics are highly suspect for the company. Which I would say is fine, no one has to buy it obviously, but they also can't defend it by trying to logically argue otherwise. Eat the heat and move the fuck on. Or don't fucking do it. The clothes are cool and everything but without the audience and famous acquaintances promoting the brand, it would have never even happened let alone succeeded. It's practically grifting for their major money maker but it is still their audience mostly. I'm sorry but it is what it is. I don't shed tears over the moral dilemmas of rich people and I don't think others should either. They'll make their money and they'll uselessly try to defend it. If they shut up they'll sell more."

Awesome video, it's all about fast fashion and its detriment to the environment. Also, climate town is amazing if you haven't watched.

But the thing is they don't realize how badly they're hurting people. They don't realize it because it's not like they have it in bold letters saying ""HEY WE USED OUR SLAVES TO MAKE THESE CLOTHES FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU JUST HAD TO WEAR THESE""

They don't even have anything close to that and to be honest it would tank their numbers. But would that be all bad?"
Anticonsumption,Society/Culture,Fast fashion trending,,2022,"I actually don't understand how can grown up adults just... not care?

Anticonsumption,Society/Culture,Fast fashion trending,,2022,I feel like criticizing these girls is low hanging fruit and missing the source of the problem. There’s so much money to be made from instilling deep rooted insecurities into little girls then selling them false solutions as they get older. These girls aren’t the problem.

Anticonsumption,Society/Culture,Fast fashion trending,,2022,"Gross. You get the same happy chemicals, perhaps even more from thrift store shopping. You'll never have a cool story behind an article of clothing you found on an app. You also get out of the house and shop *more* since that's where most of the enjoyment comes from.

Maybe people haven't come to terms with the fact that it's the shopping they like."

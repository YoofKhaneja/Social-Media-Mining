Watches,Discussion,[Not all fashion watches are bad] Adidas Originals Edition Two AOFH2204,"Wait, before you down vote me,  say get a Citizen instead, and that my watch is the devil, please listen. I'm in Japan & hospitalized for 6 weeks (I was hit by a car). While in the hospital, my 30th birthday passed on Oct 13th. Once nearing 30 I suddenly fell in love with watches, but I had 0 experience with them. I found this watch, but before purchasing I began to research the topic religiously (as well as watching your Teddy Bulbasaur's and what not). Every connoisseur says that fashion watches are evil & made by low quality manufacturers. However, Adidas partnered with Timex to make this watch so I gave it a shot on sale for about $85. 

This watch is LOVELY! It looks gorgeous, feels amazingly sturdy, the sound of the dial is music to my ears, and has a 10atm so I'm more than safe for day to day use. I know these things are standard, but with the rep of fashion watches I was shocked (especially for one on sale).

Maybe I chose wisely by picking a Timex production, but even on this sub people told me ""Don't buy that, get a Timex instead"" when it's inherently a Timex with an adidas logo. I'm telling you all of this to say, all fashion watches aren't awful.

Now, I'll accept my down votes. However I do have a Seiko 5 Cement on the way 😉.",2023,"I mean, aparently it is made by Timex, so that's more than most fashion brands can say"

This watch is LOVELY! It looks gorgeous, feels amazingly sturdy, the sound of the dial is music to my ears, and has a 10atm so I'm more than safe for day to day use. I know these things are standard, but with the rep of fashion watches I was shocked (especially for one on sale).

Maybe I chose wisely by picking a Timex production, but even on this sub people told me ""Don't buy that, get a Timex instead"" when it's inherently a Timex with an adidas logo. I'm telling you all of this to say, all fashion watches aren't awful.

As questionable as Ye sounds most times he’s an iconic fashion statement. Ye sets the tone for a lot of fashion decisions…. Even those annoying as big red boots, Kanye wore something similar some time ago & was literally talked about. 

He is a fashion statement with a questionable mental standpoint."
yeezys,DISCUSSION,New Adidas CEO says Kanye West is the most creative person in the Fashion Industry,,2023,"This what was said during the call. People will say, ‘you cannot destroy it’ because it’s a sustainability issue, right?” Gulden continued. “So ‘please don’t destroy.’ And on the other side, ‘please don’t sell’ because you have a reputation issue.The piles of shoes have weighed on Adidas’s stock, which has fallen 22.7% over the past 12 months but finished 2.6% higher on Wednesday. Adidas executives last month said that not selling the leftover Yeezy products could lead to 1.2 billion euros — roughly $1.27 billion — in lost sales.Gulden, during the call, said that the company opted not to halt production on the Yeezy brand to preserve jobs for its thousands of factory workers. He added that Adidas could end up giving away the shoes — or proceeds from sales.We could sell the product at cost, and it will be a zero thing,” Gulden added during the call. “We could sell it with a small margin and give the margin away for different donations. We can sell them with more margin and give more donations.”“I think the goal that we have is to do what the probability is that it damages us the least, and that we do something good,” he added.Gulden said he had likely received hundreds of business proposals from others who wanted to buy up the Yeezy leftovers."

stocks,Company Discussion,"Adidas to End Kanye West Partnership After Controversies; Adidas: was “one of the most successful collaborations in our industry's history""","* **German company may announce it is severing ties on Tuesday**
* **Adidas has been under pressure after antisemitic remarks by Ye** 
* **Adidas would join Gap Inc. and Kering SA’s Balenciaga fashion label in cutting ties with West, who now goes by Ye**
* **Adidas shares, already weighed down by the controversy, fell as much as 3.2% in Frankfurt trading, reaching the lowest since April 2016.**
* **Yeezy line accounted for as much as 8% of Adidas's total sales** 
* **For Adidas, was “one of the most successful collaborations in our industry’s history.”**  

Adidas AG plans to end its partnership with Kanye West following a rash of offensive behavior from the rapper and designer that turned a once-thriving shoe brand into a lightning rod for criticism.

The German sports company may announce the move as early as Tuesday, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because discussions are private. A representative for Adidas didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. 

**Adidas would join Gap Inc. and Kering SA’s Balenciaga fashion label in cutting ties with West, who now goes by Ye**. The rapper has made controversial statements, including antisemitic social media posts in recent weeks, and has moved to cut ties with his corporate partners. Ye couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.

**Adidas shares, already weighed down by the controversy, fell as much as 3.2% in Frankfurt trading, reaching the lowest since April 2016.**

**The Adidas decision follows weeks of deliberations inside the company, which over the past decade has built the Yeezy line -- together with Ye -- into a brand that’s accounted for as much as 8% of Adidas’s total sales**, according to several estimates from Wall Street analysts. 

The German company is of the view that it owns the intellectual property rights to the products from the collaboration and could continue producing the models, one of the people said.

**Adidas earlier this month called the partnership “one of the most successful collaborations in our industry’s history”** and said it will continue co-managing Yeezy products during its review.

That success, however, has come with plenty of acrimony between the partners. Ye has accused Adidas of copying his ideas and mismanaging the brand, and taunted outgoing Chief Executive Officer Kasper Rorsted on social media. Meanwhile, Adidas has said it’s repeatedly tried and failed to resolve issues with Ye privately.

The rapper said in September he wants to negotiate with Adidas to get a 20% royalty on all the shoes he’s designed with the company in perpetuity.

Ye caused more controversy after that by wearing a shirt at the Paris fashion week that said “White Lives Matter.” He later got locked out of his Twitter and Instagram accounts after making repeated anti-Semitic remarks -- remarks that have created a growing backlash of consumers and celebrities, with some calling for people to boycott Adidas products until the partnership is canceled.

The Ye situation is one of many headaches for Adidas, which is searching for a new CEO to take over in 2023. The company has lowered its earnings forecast several times this year amid falling demand for its shoes and apparel in China and growing signs of economic trouble in Europe and North America.

The rapper said in September he wants to negotiate with Adidas to get a 20% royalty on all the shoes he’s designed with the company in perpetuity.

Ye caused more controversy after that by wearing a shirt at the Paris fashion week that said “White Lives Matter.” He later got locked out of his Twitter and Instagram accounts after making repeated anti-Semitic remarks -- remarks that have created a growing backlash of consumers and celebrities, with some calling for people to boycott Adidas products until the partnership is canceled.

The Ye situation is one of many headaches for Adidas, which is searching for a new CEO to take over in 2023. The company has lowered its earnings forecast several times this year amid falling demand for its shoes and apparel in China and growing signs of economic trouble in Europe and North America.

Adidas AG plans to end its partnership with Kanye West following a rash of offensive behavior from the rapper and designer that turned a once-thriving shoe brand into a lightning rod for criticism.

The German sports company may announce the move as early as Tuesday, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because discussions are private. A representative for Adidas didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Ye caused more controversy after that by wearing a shirt at the Paris fashion week that said “White Lives Matter.” He later got locked out of his Twitter and Instagram accounts after making repeated anti-Semitic remarks -- remarks that have created a growing backlash of consumers and celebrities, with some calling for people to boycott Adidas products until the partnership is canceled.

The Ye situation is one of many headaches for Adidas, which is searching for a new CEO to take over in 2023. The company has lowered its earnings forecast several times this year amid falling demand for its shoes and apparel in China and growing signs of economic trouble in Europe and North America.

**Adidas shares, already weighed down by the controversy, fell as much as 3.2% in Frankfurt trading, reaching the lowest since April 2016.**

**The Adidas decision follows weeks of deliberations inside the company, which over the past decade has built the Yeezy line -- together with Ye -- into a brand that’s accounted for as much as 8% of Adidas’s total sales**, according to several estimates from Wall Street analysts. 

The German company is of the view that it owns the intellectual property rights to the products from the collaboration and could continue producing the models, one of the people said.

**Adidas earlier this month called the partnership “one of the most successful collaborations in our industry’s history”** and said it will continue co-managing Yeezy products during its review.

That success, however, has come with plenty of acrimony between the partners. Ye has accused Adidas of copying his ideas and mismanaging the brand, and taunted outgoing Chief Executive Officer Kasper Rorsted on social media. Meanwhile, Adidas has said it’s repeatedly tried and failed to resolve issues with Ye privately.

The rapper said in September he wants to negotiate with Adidas to get a 20% royalty on all the shoes he’s designed with the company in perpetuity.

Ye caused more controversy after that by wearing a shirt at the Paris fashion week that said “White Lives Matter.” He later got locked out of his Twitter and Instagram accounts after making repeated anti-Semitic remarks -- remarks that have created a growing backlash of consumers and celebrities, with some calling for people to boycott Adidas products until the partnership is canceled.

The Ye situation is one of many headaches for Adidas, which is searching for a new CEO to take over in 2023. The company has lowered its earnings forecast several times this year amid falling demand for its shoes and apparel in China and growing signs of economic trouble in Europe and North America.

Adidas AG plans to end its partnership with Kanye West following a rash of offensive behavior from the rapper and designer that turned a once-thriving shoe brand into a lightning rod for criticism.

The German sports company may announce the move as early as Tuesday, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because discussions are private. A representative for Adidas didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

We primarily worked with large fashion groups similar to J. Crew or Adidas etc. These kinds of disputes happen all the time and it’s mostly large companies taking a chance on cornering the market on branding for things that most people would consider public domain. It always gets in the news and people get all shocked about it, but for a company of Adidas size the legal costs of this are a drop in the bucket, so why not give it a shot? Adidas may win, they may lose. Either way they’re not very worried about their bottom line. A lot of times they just want to set a precedent so other companies can’t use any designs even vaguely similar to theirs."

Weird,,Balenciaga and adidas with a Gimp fashion show,,2022,"I never said I liked it. I said I could appreciate it. It’s art. It’s subjective. It’s as wasteful as any painting or print. It’s as disposable as any piece of literature and as fleeting as any 5 star restaurant dish. Nobody said you had to like it, but to discard it so deftly just shows how you don’t really appreciate anything. I doubt anything you do has any lasting impact on you or on others. You’re ordinary, which makes it easy to sit behind a screen and criticize. You have a dearth of worth, so you choose to ridicule those who live in other worlds."
Weird,,Balenciaga and adidas with a Gimp fashion show,,2022,"That was an overreaction and unnecessarily vindictive considering I was polite and just expressing my opinion on it as you did. I appreciated your opinion without aggressively attacking you. Nor did I say that you liked it just that those who do are allowed too.

I don't understand how you misinterpreted my comment as a negative towards you, unless you wanted to be offended.
As you said it's subjective - you're allowed to disagree but to degrade me because my opinion on it differs from yours is absolutely disgusting form. The fact that art is subjective means that I can not appreciate it and that's allowed without being berated and belittled by you. 
The Mona Lisa is art and some people don't like it.
I now no longer value your opinion and you calling me ordinary means absolutely zero.
Your statement was absolutely ridiculous and to disparage me because of it was horrendous behaviour 'Agree with me or else'.
This exchange says more about you than me.

This however cannot be compared to a Monet or Picasso."

nba,,"Adidas cut ties with Kanye in short order after his antisemitic rhetoric was made public, why hasn't Nike done the same with Kyrie?","A couple weeks ago Kanye had started making tweets and IG posts that went into details that included blatant antisemitism. Within a weeks time, Kanye had to face some serious repercussions, including the termination of his deal with Adidas for his fashion line Yeezy. This resulted in a $250million profit hit for Adidas, but the company made clear that Kanye was no longer a fitting representative for their brand.

We are now in the midst of a similar situation where Kyrie has been noted as tweeting about a film that depicts hateful antisemitic viewpoints (Kyrie denies this but it's been proven to be true). Kyrie has doubled down in similar fashion to how Kanye responded, saying that he's the victim and not taking responsibility or showing any remorse for his actions.

That leads me to the question, why hasn't Nike cut their deal with Kyrie yet? The fact is that the deal between Nike and Kyrie is set to expire after next season, and Kyrie's shoe line isn't valued nearly as much as the Yeezy brand line was, so the argument of financial impact doesn't stand up either. When you factor in the fact that Kyrie plays in not only one of the biggest baseball markets, but one heavily populated with Jewish people, it would only make sense for Nike to cut ties at this point.

Adidas generated a lot of positive buzz and goodwill with the general public, at some point people are going to start looking to Nike if Kyrie continues his actions, wondering when they will do the same. If I were Nike I'd cut ties now and focus on rolling out a new signature line to replace him. There's been rumors that Morant might be next on Nike's list for a signature line, this may be the push they need to speed that process up.",2022,"The answer is in your post, Kanye directly tweeted antisemitism while kyrie tweeted about a film that has antisemitism in it, that’s the main difference, Kanye’s looks (and arguably is) way worse."

Adidas was one of the last companies to cut ties with Kanye, about 9 days after the podcast where he repeated previous antisemitism and taunted that they wouldnt part ways with him. After many outlets wondered why it hadnt yet done so. And this was after a newspaper showed the decline in their corporate performance during their association with him (correlation doesnt necessarily mean causation, but the association didnt help its performance, evidently).

So, based on the timeline, and if the comparison is adidas, the answer is that Nike can still wait 8 days and respond quicker to Kyrie than adidas responded to Kanye."

I've never practiced Judaism a day in my life, in fact I'm the son of a Baptist minister, but my grandfather was 100% Ashkenazi Jew and when I get an ancestral DNA test it just labels me 25% Ashkenazi Jew, not even country specific.

When my wife and I went for a checkup when she was pregnant, the doctors made us get genetic screening for rare Ashkenazi genetic defects that cause rare really shitty diseases. I can't make myself any less Jewish by blood than Kyrie can make himself less Lakota. It has absolutely nothing to do with my religious beliefs, it's an attack on part of who I am.

books,,Discuss: Is TikTok Is Turning Books Into Fast Fashion?,,2023,"I don’t think it’s so much tiktok as it is the publishing industry that exploits the hype of BookTok. 

Like the upcoming Sarah J Maas release that has 5 different editions with special chapters in each, incentivizing people to buy all 5 copies that 10 years down the road will probably end up in the landfill. 

The recent Red Tower release and the massive amount of misprints that are leading people to exchange books (fair enough), which means they have to reprint and ship out more books because they rushed it to capitalize on the hype. AND I just saw that they are planning on releasing a holiday edition of Iron Flame that just came out two days ago. 

So many special edition covers that get released and improperly packaged then arrive to the consumer slightly damaged and are then exchanged for pristine copies. 

I don’t begrudge people for wanting perfect copies of books when they are spending up to $100 on them, but I do wonder what is done with the slightly damaged copies and the environmental impact the publishing industry is having. 

TLDR; overconsumption is a problem and the publishing industry isn’t exempt from it.

EDIT: I admit I didn’t read the article before writing my comment and I was surprised that it focused more on the improper use of Gaelic since the comparison was to fast fashion. Given that Scottish Gaelic is a dying language, I understand why people are protective of it and want it pronounced correctly."

Yes, TikTok is a powerful marketing tool, and yes, the world is changing. But ""fast fashion"" books have existed for *generations.* As a more recent example, think of all the supernatural romance books that came out after Twilight, or the dystopian books that came out after The Hunger Games.

If I had $1000 shein would be the last place I shop...

TikTokCringe,Discussion,Fast fashion makes me so angry,,2021,"Who casually spends $1k in one go? I think that's probably my wardrobe budget for a whole year and not even that. I think this last year I spend $120 in jeans at American Eagle, other than that I spent less than $50 total in second hand polo shirts and long-sleeves for work.

Edit: Imagine thinking that spending less than $1k a year in clothes is a controversial comment that deserves all this attention"
TikTokCringe,Discussion,Fast fashion makes me so angry,,2021,"I’m gonna say something controversial but if you really care for these poor brown people (and I’m ethnically from countries where they produce these textiles) you’ll do things like support refugees, climate change policies, social welfare to the poor.

Simply acting high and mighty over what clothes you wear while you enjoy your iPhone and similar mass made outsourced goods is hypocritical.

My wife and I love shein. Shit some of my distant relatives help make it."
TikTokCringe,Discussion,Fast fashion makes me so angry,,2021,Shein is an absolute garbage company. They use formaldehyde to preserve the crispness of their underwear and it's been known to cause vaginally infections in customers. Not to mention the fact that most items cost <$10 so they're no doubt using slave labour.

Rather, it is quite literally the constant push of more and more clothing releases. I would assume the only reason most Teddy Fresh customers don’t have a significant amount of items is because of the high price tag, rather than the company not being “fast fashion.” Fast fashion is the concept of companies persistently pushing new things in customers’ faces, persuading them they need to catch up on a new style, and with only a limited amount of closet space, people will ultimately donate or throw out “outdated” clothes. Unfortunately, the vast majority of apparel donated to charities or thrift stores still do end up in landfills. I would love to some how get in touch with the company and discuss environmental sustainable practices and solutions if they are interested on how they can stray away from fast fashion."

also how long they’re working on it is great and all but if it’s a drop every month, you’re still creating a full line for every month … it’s just offset, there’s no logic there.

there’s better less deflective ways to defend TF"

i've been watching h3 since they were still in Israel and there isn't a podcast episode i've skipped, though i've skipped segments hosting people i dont care to see. I've never bought a single Teddy Fresh product, but i felt the quality in person back when they were still sold at Zumiez. There have been things i've wanted, but they sold out really quickly. 

From what i can understand without really knowing the management structure and HR practices of the company, i can only assume the company is a good one to work for, though what really matters to me is how the clothes feels, looks, fits, and it's price. the moral standards behind the company is beyond me and i couldn't be fucked and/or sucked to look into every company who gets my dollar.

that being said...;

i had to google the definition of ""fast fashion"", and i just have to say... what the hell does Ethan or Hila know or care about Magic: The Gathering? That collab came out of left fucking field, because Ethan and Hila has never, ever talked about MTG from my *YEARS* of watching them. It looks like the cards they picked were picked just because they looked cool. 

[Earl Of Squirrel](https://teddyfresh.com/products/tf-x-magic-the-gathering-earl-of-squirrel-tee) is cool looking card, it's a neat little character for people who dont know MTG, but it's basically a meme with how useless it is. also, it just looks like it was a shirt bought at walmart, with how it's literally just [the card art](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/154762/magic-the-gathering-launch-party-and-release-event-promos-earl-of-squirrel-draft-weekend?country=US&utm_campaign=18142757028&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=&utm_term=&adgroupid=&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAyKurBhD5ARIsALamXaGYBpOOqn4ISKHs00QxQBEEjbPT7Bqv-YrM1EDGzvmEbaE2w14MZQ8aAl4TEALw_wcB&Language=English) transferred to a shirt. 

[Reanimate](https://teddyfresh.com/products/tf-x-magic-the-gathering-reanimate-sweatshirt) sweatshirt is a cool art style, but i guess you can really thank Robert Bliss for that, the person who designed the card art. the sweatshirt is so bland and the text looks like it was randomly pasted on. whoever was responsible for that really just [dulled down the card art](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/5684/magic-the-gathering-tempest-reanimate?country=US&utm_campaign=18142757028&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=&utm_term=&adgroupid=&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAyKurBhD5ARIsALamXaHex5XnJxaRPP0uPfiJu-FlK_qOsqGFCHFYw8Ce91ws59Bu8JEbCWIaAq-6EALw_wcB&Language=English) and put the most basic references of it on a sweatshirt

who in the hell wants to wear [Serendib Efreet](https://teddyfresh.com/products/tf-x-magic-the-gathering-serendib-efreet-tee) merch? it's a [shit card](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/118737/magic-eternal-masters-serendib-efreet?xid=pi57b5781f-b6ac-4e43-8fe6-6a5bad608da8&Language=English&page=1). magic players dont care about the card, random people who dont play magic dont care about the card. who is this for? this is for magic players who'd wear it ironically or people who're admitting with a bullhorn that they're posers.

how about some cards from the Mox Set? easy bangers there, especially with TF style they used for the collab. Chrome Mox, Mox Diamond... but lets say MTG said ""only do cards that were still modern and currently printed"" ( i know that wasn't the case with the 1997 Tempest: Reanimate, but..) how about do clothes for Commander sets, modern sets, standard sets and get the most iconic art from those sets. even the basic lands would look great. Everyone likes and plays Soul Ring, there's a lot of creative opportunity there. and Unsets? The quality in clothes is probably ok and the designs dont look bad, but this MTG collab didn't have any input from actual MTG fans. To be fair to Teddy Fresh, there isn't a lot of other options for official MTG merch that are on good quality clothes. after searching what ""fast fashion"" meant, this almost fits the bill, with how lazy the designs felt, with how the card art was copy-pasted on some clothes or blown up to cover the shirt. all they had to do is ask some genuine magic fans/players about which cards to use, assuming wizards of the coast let them have that creative liberty. 

this isn't a gatekeep. as someone else said (about literally the same topic), ""im not a hater. I'm 'booing' because i *want* to cheer"". they almost had a customer out of me because of that collab, but for that price they charge, they need to work harder on the designs.

The problem is fast fashion brands pump out new collections every couple of weeks. And thats bad for the environment.

TF definitely pumps out more collections than luxury brands who generally have only 2 per year: Fall/Winter & Spring/summer. TF does lots different collaborations, remakes of their old collections and other collections on top of the seasonal collections. So in this sense, yes TF is a fast fashion brand. 

TF should be compared more to Zara, or H&M. Quality clothes, but they also do lots of different collections per year and are considered “fast fashion”

EDIT: Seems like people are not applying logic to what I wrote and are focusing on E-E times and that quality is better than H&M/ Zara. The environmental problem is with how many collections they are dropping, which is also one of the staples of fast fashion (lots of drops throughout the year). Instead of buying clothes only through their Summer or Winter drop, like high-end brands do, you end up buying clothes from 8-10 collections per year. More collections = more clothes in the landfill"

I respect Ethan and Hila both as people but this is hype beast nonsense. Is it fast fashion though? I don't think so but they also aren't far off. They're doing it for themselves and their investors. Neither you or them needs to defend it. If they want to cash grab in front of people they should eat the heat and move on. You're making no graces with your progressive crowd, which they chose to embrace, regardless of what you say when you act like a blatant capitalist. It's that simple. No whitewashing from you or them will change the reality of two super wealthy people trying to become more wealthy for the benefit of themselves and their ethics are highly suspect for the company. Which I would say is fine, no one has to buy it obviously, but they also can't defend it by trying to logically argue otherwise. Eat the heat and move the fuck on. Or don't fucking do it. The clothes are cool and everything but without the audience and famous acquaintances promoting the brand, it would have never even happened let alone succeeded. It's practically grifting for their major money maker but it is still their audience mostly. I'm sorry but it is what it is.

femalefashionadvice,,Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?,"Over the last year, I’ve gotten much more interested in sustainable & ethical clothing and have immersed myself in researching these topics. 

Questions like: is _____ ethical? Is _____ sustainable? Where can I buy affordable but ethical clothing? Plague my google search history. 

As a 24 year old who is finally making a decent salary but has been primarily a fast fashion consumer up until a year or so ago, I want to do and be better. 

But a point I’ve seen made many times while reading countless articles about clothing manufacturing ethics and sustainability is that by definition, fast fashion is bad because it’s not made to last and is made for mass consumption. Trendy pieces and cheaply made pieces made to last maybe a season or two. 

So where does that leave the consumer who has a closet full of items purchased at fast fashion retailers, but rarely makes new purchases and many of their current pieces have remained in their closet for years? 

Obviously the issue is layered and nuanced. Sure maybe I have a fast fashion t shirt that cost me $3 that I’ve gotten three years of wear out of, but obviously a $3 shirt wasn’t made sustainably or ethically. But is there a point where the trade off of ethics and sustainability becomes worth it? 

Is the “fast fashion” buyer who makes new purchases maybe a few times a year and keeps that clothing for years better or worse than the “mid range” clothing buyer who buys clothing monthly (or maybe even more?) and gets fewer uses out of each article of clothing? 

This topic bothers me because I feel like there’s no good choice unless you have $$$ to spend on the few brands that are sustainable and ethical. Is Aritzia or J Crew that much better than Forever 21 or Fashion Nova? Is the clothing quality that much better that it warrants a 300%+ price increase? Are their ethics/sustainability practices better?

Even luxury and designer brands have questionable histories, like Chanel. 

It’s just so frustrating! I feel like in the last year or two in particular there has been a sharp uptick in clothing “boutiques” and online only clothing stores which just muddy the waters further & make the shopping process that much more confusing for the average consumer. 

I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts on this matter! This has been bugging me for forever and no one IRL I know wants to have this conversation.

ETA: I just want to include that for the time being I’ve decided to predominantly buy secondhand and have been buying clothes through Vinted pretty much exclusively for the last year, until I can find other options I am comfortable with :)",2021,"The defining characteristic of fast fashion is its 2-12 week production cycle. It's not about how long you or any individual customer keeps any individual item.

It's also not about you in another sense. Fast fashion brands pump out up to 24 collections a year - that's a lot of clothes. [It's well-documented that this is an overproduction of clothing](https://sharecloth.com/blog/reports/apparel-overproduction), and even though the post-production circulation of this clothing [has its own deleterious effects](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-fashion-blog/2015/feb/13/second-hand-clothes-charity-donations-africa#comment-47509657), even if every customer kept their fast fashion purchases for 10 years, [the cost of this enormous production volume would remain](https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/december-2019-march-2020/battling-damaging-effects-%E2%80%98fast-fashion%E2%80%99). This is a systemic problem, and you can't solve it by keeping all your H&M t-shirts for 10 years.

And like, I get where this OP is coming from. I think there is a tendency, particularly on this sub, to blame the unsustainability of the fashion industry on individual consumers, which forces individual consumers to justify their fast fashion purchases as still sustainable in some sense. And of course blaming the individual for the crimes of fast fashion completely misses the point, and most of the solutions that people come up with (just make your own clothes!!111) are totally asinine. It's also kind of insidious how this personal responsibility rhetoric essentially protects corporations and governments from civil society coming together to push for system-level change - especially given that corporations in particular promote personal responsibility to sustainability (buying Eileen Fisher is basically just as impactful as pushing tighter environmental regulations!). I think this rhetoric pushes people to fight between themselves rather than banding together to push for meaningful change.

So I just also want to say that none of this is your fault. You're not a bad person if you can't afford to not buy fast fashion, and you don't owe anybody an excuse for surviving in the system you're in. But I think it's also important to draw a line between defending yourself from accusations of unsustainability and defending the industry from the same - and unfortunately, because of the way we've structured this rhetoric in the US and in this sub in particular, the two usually get blurred."

Trendy pieces and cheaply made pieces made to last maybe a season or two. 

So where does that leave the consumer who has a closet full of items purchased at fast fashion retailers, but rarely makes new purchases and many of their current pieces have remained in their closet for years? 

Obviously the issue is layered and nuanced. Sure maybe I have a fast fashion t shirt that cost me $3 that I’ve gotten three years of wear out of, but obviously a $3 shirt wasn’t made sustainably or ethically. But is there a point where the trade off of ethics and sustainability becomes worth it? 

Is the “fast fashion” buyer who makes new purchases maybe a few times a year and keeps that clothing for years better or worse than the “mid range” clothing buyer who buys clothing monthly (or maybe even more?) and gets fewer uses out of each article of clothing? 

This topic bothers me because I feel like there’s no good choice unless you have $$$ to spend on the few brands that are sustainable and ethical. Is Aritzia or J Crew that much better than Forever 21 or Fashion Nova? Is the clothing quality that much better that it warrants a 300%+ price increase? Are their ethics/sustainability practices better?

Even luxury and designer brands have questionable histories, like Chanel. 

It’s just so frustrating! I feel like in the last year or two in particular there has been a sharp uptick in clothing “boutiques” and online only clothing stores which just muddy the waters further & make the shopping process that much more confusing for the average consumer. 

I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts on this matter! This has been bugging me for forever and no one IRL I know wants to have this conversation.

It makes selecting the “sustainable option” nuanced and compromising for individual consumers. While I think awareness of the impact of your choices is incredibly valuable and focusing on sustainability as a priority when exercising your purchase power makes a difference, I really resent the pressure being put on individuals to “make the right choice” when it comes at a cost (either literally or figuratively) in another scenario. 
Companies have spent decades funding the message that we, the individual consumers, are responsible for the impact consumerism has on the environment. While supply and demand obviously go hand in hand, the true goal for individual consumers should be focusing their voting power on demanding companies take responsibility of intersectional sustainability (ie you shouldn’t have to be privileged to purchase sustainable products). Change does come with purchase power, but right now there will always be a trade off. It’s up to voting for government officials and policies that give ownership of the problem as shared responsibility between consumers and companies (but primarily on companies). 
All in all, outside of voting, the best thing you can do is be conscious of what you’re purchasing and where it goes when you’re done with it. Align to priorities that map to yours (whether it’s low carbon impact, human rights, circular economics, water / land impact etc), and do the best you can in that area understanding there’s other consumers who prioritize other aspects of sustainability that are meaningful to them. Even if you can’t find the perfect solution, every conscious effort helps."

Plus, when I do shop it's only for the things I need, and I'll often go months without buying any new clothes.

Meanwhile there are plenty of wealthy people (or middle class people) buying top-name brands who throw out their wardrobe every year and replace the whole thing, or go shopping every weekend.

And ultimately a brand saying they're made more sustainably doesn't mean they're completely free of any exploitation or harm to the environment, either. It's unfair to put this huge burden on the consumer to live in a perfectly environmentally-friendly way when the vast majority of the *blame* for harm to the environment is on major corporations who are actually doing the mass producing. It's also unfair to hold up a standard of individual moral ""purity"" that the majority of people cannot afford. Ultimately, saving the environment is something that will only be accomplished with the cooperation of those with the power to make large-scale change, and currently those corporations put an undue amount of pressure on individual consumer decision-making instead of making those decisions themselves.

But I digress a bit - to answer your question, i think it's more about how you buy and consume things than about the label. If you limit what you buy to just what you need with a couple of indulgences here and there, and shop thrift stores or resold items instead of buying new all the time, you're being WAY more sustainable than someone who drops the cash on buying high-end ""green"" brands in amounts way more than they need."

So has r/frugal I guess and there are a few other subs. I don't think there is a fixed rule. The world is changing too fast for that.

Maybe the key is to scale down spending, thrift as much as possible and be critical when shopping. Price does not necessarily equals quality.  

The way I see it, high-end brands are just expensive. Nowadays luxury brands seem to be as mass-produced as anything else. Profit above all.

I also have realized that brand loyalty in the 21st century might have become a bit silly. I have trusted brands in the past but it seems pointless now, bc even sizing can change randomly.

Maybe customers shd spend more carefully. Buy what is needed, make sure what you are getting is looking good on you, it looks well-made and it feels nice on your skin. It is better to have fewer garments that make you look superb than many trashy pieces that will not do you any justice. Every person has their beauty, we shd only have and wear what makes us look fabulous.

Also 24 with money and a recent interest in sustainable fashion. I originally got interested in the issue after watching some of Bernadette Banner's videos, I highly recommend if you haven't heard of her! She's a fashion historian with some really great video essays. 

In regards to your actual question, for me it comes down to labor practices. Yes, keeping fast fashion items in your closet longer than ""typical"" is good, but they were still made by severely underpaying workers who are often women and children. I've been trying to research companies that have ethical supply chains and put info about their factories and workforce online. It is very pricey I'll admit, but I feel good knowing someone was paid fairly for sewing it, since garment making is very hard work! It also makes me think harder about whether i need something for my closet or i just want it. 

It is a really complex and nuanced issue, and at the end of the day, there is no perfect company. Global supply chains and growing fibers for clothes both pollute. But we can try to support the best companies in the hopes of making a difference"

Technically,  yes. You have consumed fast fashion. It was made quickly, likely exploitatively, and unsustainably. Someone was probably severely underpaid and/or worked in unsafe conditions. Environmental damage was likely done to produce the fabrics and dyes. There is likely also textile waste dumped in association with your garments' creations. Even if your consumption is slow, and you are trying to hold onto things, you've moved your consumption practices to a place that is sustainable and ethical, it's still on someone's back and likely harming the planet.

**HOWEVER!!!!**

I understand that sustainable fashion is expensive. Ethical and fair trade is a lot for most people. One garment is a car note, half a rent payment, 2 weeks of groceries. It's a huge mind shift after generations of textile and clothing prices plummeting. It also highlights our own experiences with inequality, expectations around grooming, consumption, and presentation. I remember being my early 20s and buying suits from H&M because it was expected to dress stylishly, professionally, and in a way that reflected the company. I couldn't always even afford that and frankly, it cost me opportunities, professional relationships, and more because of the perception of poverty and other negative associations including, but not limited to my race, gender, and social class.

I can't preach to anyone who is paying off student loan debt, trying to build a savings account, sending money home to family, or just trying to keep up well enough until hitting a point of something resembling financial security about buying a $10 USD or less shirt. I think these systems are connected and exploitative, but I don't think it's the fault of the individual consumer for being forced into the cycle. We can think bigger, be conscientious, and try to put our money and time in places that are moving towards a positive direction.

You're already taking these steps by caring for your things. I don't know if you mend, but it'll extend the life. Skip the dryer, it helps preserve the fabric. You are taking responsibility and reducing your footprint. Is it perfect, no. Is that okay... I think we can only do the best we can with the resources available to us.

Some people may come and talk about thrifting or sewing your own clothing. This too has a cost.

Thrifting makes that too expensive for people who have to thrift. So where's the balance? How can we as consumers make this space more equitable? How can companies? Can we hold them accountable? What's the impact when it's supporting small businesses -- young women who have time to search the shops and get the clothing that is less expensive than new to women who have means, but not enough for high end clothing? What conversations and considerations could we have to rethink consumption in the second hand market? Including how even that contributes to textile waste.

Sewing is NOT cheap. Yes, there are some influencers (usually young, thin, beautiful) who sew bedsheets and tablecloths (functional, but I'm not going to get into why that probably shouldn't a long term way to work). There's still a lot to learn, consider with fabric purchases (is this a polluting material? is this at an exploitative price? why is this cheap? where did it come from?). Some people get super cheap yardage, but it's worth looking into why is it cheap. By the yard, it can get expensive. Then there's the labor. I think about how much my dinky, simplistic, me-made garments would retail with labor and materials cost and it's not cheap if I calculate at a living wage independent of other business expenses.

It's complicated, but I'm super jazzed you're thinking about this. The large and small impacts and challenging what do these labels mean. What do our habits do in the long run? Why do we hold some designers in such high regard and what does affordable and sustainable mean? I ask that always when someone asks for something affordable. ""What is affordable to this person? Near free? $50? $100? Does this person's affordable exploit someone else? Does this person's affordable make the next life decision simpler for them and they can go on another day?"""
femalefashionadvice,,Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?,"Over the last year, I’ve gotten much more interested in sustainable & ethical clothing and have immersed myself in researching these topics. 

Questions like: is _____ ethical? Is _____ sustainable? Where can I buy affordable but ethical clothing? Plague my google search history. 

As a 24 year old who is finally making a decent salary but has been primarily a fast fashion consumer up until a year or so ago, I want to do and be better. 

But a point I’ve seen made many times while reading countless articles about clothing manufacturing ethics and sustainability is that by definition, fast fashion is bad because it’s not made to last and is made for mass consumption. Trendy pieces and cheaply made pieces made to last maybe a season or two. 

So where does that leave the consumer who has a closet full of items purchased at fast fashion retailers, but rarely makes new purchases and many of their current pieces have remained in their closet for years? 

Obviously the issue is layered and nuanced. Sure maybe I have a fast fashion t shirt that cost me $3 that I’ve gotten three years of wear out of, but obviously a $3 shirt wasn’t made sustainably or ethically. But is there a point where the trade off of ethics and sustainability becomes worth it? 

Is the “fast fashion” buyer who makes new purchases maybe a few times a year and keeps that clothing for years better or worse than the “mid range” clothing buyer who buys clothing monthly (or maybe even more?) and gets fewer uses out of each article of clothing? 

This topic bothers me because I feel like there’s no good choice unless you have $$$ to spend on the few brands that are sustainable and ethical. Is Aritzia or J Crew that much better than Forever 21 or Fashion Nova? Is the clothing quality that much better that it warrants a 300%+ price increase? Are their ethics/sustainability practices better?

Even luxury and designer brands have questionable histories, like Chanel. 

It’s just so frustrating! I feel like in the last year or two in particular there has been a sharp uptick in clothing “boutiques” and online only clothing stores which just muddy the waters further & make the shopping process that much more confusing for the average consumer. 

I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts on this matter! This has been bugging me for forever and no one IRL I know wants to have this conversation.

ETA: I just want to include that for the time being I’ve decided to predominantly buy secondhand and have been buying clothes through Vinted pretty much exclusively for the last year, until I can find other options I am comfortable with :)",2021,"I'm in a very similar boat as you! I try to donate, upcycle, or trade any clothes I get rid of instead of just throwing them out to try to offset any damage done by the item's production, but it really is difficult to totally rebrand your closet. Also, I tend to just clear wear clothes out. Most places won't take donations if they don't have any life left.

I like buying new clothes. I grew up poor and often had few clothes, all ill-fitted or worn out. I also hate to waste clothes, and I cringe when I see an item above $50. I think it is okay to allow yourself to indulge from time to time, but most people will choose to get cheaper clothes in order to get more bang for their buck. It's also so hard to really know when the price tag truly correlates with quality. I've bought very expensive clothes than wore out faster than stuff I got from Walmart. There's also something to be said here about the sticky poverty trap... sometimes people are aware of problematic sellers but need clothes and can't afford to splurge. Sustainable clothing is an investment that not everyone can make. I know there were times that I cherished cheap fast fashion items, took good care of them, and tried not to feel to guilty. 

I think it does come down to person choice, we'd all love to live lives completely removed from  unethical and predatory business practice, but it's okay to be realistic and realize that some of these things are so ingrained in our society that you have to take part of some of it unless you want to build a log cabin off the grid and never do anything ever again. It's quite the connundrum and I'm no expert... you've got to balance personal efficacy with how far you want to go to prevent unethical production. Personally I avoid companies that I know are bad, go to ones I know are good (when I can afford it), but I generally do go by what is most economical for me because as I mentioned it's hard to know the truth about every random company.

I wanted to compare this to food, too. There are so many problems with mass farming, but it is quite a privilege to be able to grow your own food and only buy high quality, organic stuff. Most people want that but that doesn't mean they can start buying 1/3 as much food as usual. Clothes is a little different because it's part luxury, part utility, but I think the idea still applies. It's a weird line to walk; I am not going to suffer if I don't get a new work dress, but my quality of life can improve from having a nice wardrobe and I may not have the opportunity to take the high road there

Sorry if this reply was all over the place, I'm at work and this is just kind of a brainstorm"

If you already own something that wasn’t made ethically or sustainably, there’s no benefit in trashing it if you still like it and can use it. In a similar vein, there’s already so much clothing out there, that buying something second hand that’s still in good shape is often an option.

I think aritzia and j crew are still fast fashion, just more expensive fast fashion than old navy or forever 21- they’re still introducing tons of new products and feeding in to the consumerist drive to have the newest things. 

No one is perfect, but we can strive to reduce our impact on an individual scale and aim to reduce our purchases, focus on buying used when it’s possible and try to purchase ethical and local when it’s not. 
I definitely am not perfect on this front, but I try and buy from consignment shops as a first choice when I want something, and I’m working to choose smaller brands that have clear supply chains and ethical manufacturing. If it’s made in Canada (where I’m from) then that’s awesome. 
At the end of the day I hope that my fashion choices exploit the least number of people and has the lowest environmental impact possible, and often that looks like me telling myself I don’t really need the new thing, even if I think it’s amazing and really really want it"

ETA: I just want to include that for the time being I’ve decided to predominantly buy secondhand and have been buying clothes through Vinted pretty much exclusively for the last year, until I can find other options I am comfortable with :)",2021,"I’ve thought about this as well and there’s a couple conclusions I’ve come to. 


First of all, I buy a lot of secondhand, but most if not all secondhand clothes started their life as fast fashion. I have secondhand clothes from Uniqlo, anthro, urban outfitters, etc. and the pieces were meant to be trendy at the time but they fit my style and I can get a lot of use out of them. But they were made firstly as fast fashion. 


Second, fast fashion uses a lot of synthetic fibers such as polyester, which sheds tiny particles and makes it into the ecosystem and affects plants and animals. This is bad, and no matter what you buy if it’s polyester, acrylic, nylon, etc it will do this. 


But you can’t just throw a frankly huge amount of clothes away, because it won’t degrade for a long time and throwing away those clothes would require new replacement clothes. I think the only answer is that our pattern of consumption and our definition of fast fashion have to change. Owning 200 sustainably made silk dresses is fast fashion because the production and resources to make that many dresses to be owned by one person is excessive, and those dresses may only be worn a handful of times during a lifetime, which is similar to someone buying a forever21 dress and ditching it after a few wears. The silk dresses will decompose faster and not shed micro fibers, but also silk, cotton, linen, and other natural fibers still take a lot of resources to make and require pesticides and fertilizers. 

Basically I think in a perfect world, we would be able to stop producing new cloth for clothes for years and either buy existing clothing or rework existing clothing into new clothes. Fast fashion should be redefined as a use of resources vs just pointing a finger at certain companies. I know that changing the entire fashion industry into essentially a thrift flip or using existing fabric stocks is an insane proposal that would never really be economically possible, but all current fashion  production no matter the brand or material takes a lot of resources to make and if you’re concerned about it the best thing to do is buy less, buy secondhand, repurpose secondhand, and own your clothing for as long as possible."

Of course, there are are ethical retailers out there that have lower prices, but if you are young and/or poor, there is a certain amount of fast fashion that you need to buy because it fits your price/budget. Even though it isn’t ideal, not all fast fashion is gone in a couple years, if you are buying less trendy pieces you can wear for a while.

Many things I’ve bought from fast fashion retailers I’ve had for years - I haven’t changed my height or weight much in over 10 years, so I have tops from Old Navy I have had for 10 years and other clothes that have lasted way past 5 years.

Reducing consumption is a key part of ethical fashion and even if you buy it from a retailer that is cheaper because that’s what you can afford, if you keep it a long time and don’t buy a bunch of clothes all the time, you are reducing demand and helping the environment."

It's good that you're keeping and using what you buy for years (no matter what the brand), so that's a start.

Synthetics are made of plastic and can release microplastics into the environment when they are worn and washed. Cotton takes up lots of land and water. Leather lasts way longer than pleather but then you have the cruelty aspect and tanning leather does require a lot of harmful chemicals. Expensive doesn't always mean ethical, but ethical clothing does tend to cost more. There is always going to be a footprint - not buying anything at all is probably the safest and most sustainable way but obviously we still need things now and then! 

It's taken me YEARS to change my habits and transition to a better wardrobe, and even then I'm still not fast fashion-free. I had to wait to use up what I had and be able to afford something better. It took time to refine and define my style to determine what pieces would give me the most mileage. Each person will have to determine what is important to them when it comes to sustainability. Like, I'm not very picky about my purses but I tend to vet my shoes and what my options are when it comes time to repair or dispose of them."

ETA: I just want to include that for the time being I’ve decided to predominantly buy secondhand and have been buying clothes through Vinted pretty much exclusively for the last year, until I can find other options I am comfortable with :)",2021,"Would highly recommend the book [Fashionopolis](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/554229/fashionopolis-by-dana-thomas/) to OP and others who are interested in the topic -- it dives into the ethical (e.g. labor) and environmental effects of the fashion industry and what the way forward could look like (spoilers: it's not buying all of your clothes from Everlane or other ""sustainable"" brands). It's a very interesting book that profiles people doing some really interesting work, from a company that distresses jeans in a more environmentally safe way to designers working on 3D printed garments.

My personal POV is that the most sustainable thing you can do is buy less -- but there are many (myself included) who are interested in fashion and don't want a closet of exclusively ""timeless basics"" but want to sometimes swap things in and out and try out new styles. So I try and limit true ""impulse purchases"" (like, oh I bought this sweater because I saw it and thought it was cute, but then I brought it home and realized it's not my style and never wear it) and buy more secondhand. And then on top of that, I am trying to take better care of my clothes so that they do last longer, and if there are things that I want to cycle out before their time is up then they're in a condition where I could potentially donate or resell them instead of throwing them out.

As many have said in this thread and on others, it seems like the price-quality relationship has broken down for most women's clothing -- you can get a decently-made T shirt at a fast fashion store and a poorly-constructed pair of pants from a designer brand -- and both brands may have underpaid workers making their clothes, and similar environmental impacts. As a consumer I think it's basically impossible to shop 100% ethically (or even close) so it's about trying to find the incremental changes you can make while also pushing for systems to support more fundamental changes (e.g. environmental regulations)."
femalefashionadvice,,Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?,"Over the last year, I’ve gotten much more interested in sustainable & ethical clothing and have immersed myself in researching these topics. 

Questions like: is _____ ethical? Is _____ sustainable? Where can I buy affordable but ethical clothing? Plague my google search history. 

As a 24 year old who is finally making a decent salary but has been primarily a fast fashion consumer up until a year or so ago, I want to do and be better. 

But a point I’ve seen made many times while reading countless articles about clothing manufacturing ethics and sustainability is that by definition, fast fashion is bad because it’s not made to last and is made for mass consumption. Trendy pieces and cheaply made pieces made to last maybe a season or two. 

So where does that leave the consumer who has a closet full of items purchased at fast fashion retailers, but rarely makes new purchases and many of their current pieces have remained in their closet for years? 

Obviously the issue is layered and nuanced. Sure maybe I have a fast fashion t shirt that cost me $3 that I’ve gotten three years of wear out of, but obviously a $3 shirt wasn’t made sustainably or ethically. But is there a point where the trade off of ethics and sustainability becomes worth it? 

Is the “fast fashion” buyer who makes new purchases maybe a few times a year and keeps that clothing for years better or worse than the “mid range” clothing buyer who buys clothing monthly (or maybe even more?) and gets fewer uses out of each article of clothing? 

This topic bothers me because I feel like there’s no good choice unless you have $$$ to spend on the few brands that are sustainable and ethical. Is Aritzia or J Crew that much better than Forever 21 or Fashion Nova? Is the clothing quality that much better that it warrants a 300%+ price increase? Are their ethics/sustainability practices better?

Even luxury and designer brands have questionable histories, like Chanel.

Walking into this movement, the best thing you can do is keep the clothes you already own, and wear them often. Going forward, make thoughtful purchases for gaps in your wardrobe -- not as replacements for clothes that are already serving you. 

I got into sustainable fashion about two years ago. A lot of the people in that community are super privileged and/or have shopping addictions. People binge and purge on a regular basis to pay off credit cards, or they keep buying more even though their closets are ""full"". Someone in that community told me yesterday that they are setting a goal of ""only"" spending $200 a month on clothes, which they estimate is ""only"" one piece per month. Is it sustainable to consume at that rate, no matter where your clothes are coming from? 

Also -- even the ""sustainable fashion"" companies have transparency issues, sizing bias, and worker's rights controversies -- and it's a deep rabbit hole that really feels like no matter what you buy, there's an ethical dilemma attached. 

It's obviously ""complicated"" but not as complicated to get started as people make it out to be. Buy fewer, better things -- which, as a goal, includes wearing out the clothes in your closet before replacing them. Plan purchases, shop secondhand when you can, cherish (and most important -- actually wear!) what you have."

If you already have a closet full of fast fashion, taking good care of it and using it for as long as possible is the most ethical choice.  I'm in the same boat.  I'm doing a year of no new clothes/shoes purchases (only thrifted/poshmark) and I'm trying to only get things that are high quality and will last, even if they are used.  

Most of these online clothing boutiques (at least the ones I see on Poshmark/Facebook/Instagram are not sourcing ethically produced items.  I'm sure there are some that are, but they all seem to have the same stuff and you can tell just from the photos that it's cheaply made.  Again, I haven't seen every online boutique there is so I'm sure there are some out there that are fine."

europe,News,Fast fashion: EU Europe plans fast fashion crackdown,,2022,"I fear this may have some unforeseen effects.

A small part of why fast fashion is cheap is fabric quality. Most of it is from the logistics behind it. But if you up the thread counts in fabric to comply with durability standards, you massively increase the environmental impact. Especially if it's from natural fibers. Ironically enough, yarn from petrochemicals is far less carbon intensive than natural fiber yarn like cotton or linen (mostly from the energy and water required to farm).

But if it only costs slightly more, people will still want to buy new clothes so we end up with a situation where we end up having minimum impact on how many clothes people will buy but cause much more environmental impact based on a feel-good policy.

Basically, you have to think the vast majority of people buying clothes in fast fashion are doing so because they have nothing else at home for this to be impactful. This just doesn't seem true, it's mostly people who want to have latest styles and just have something ""new"". And if that's the case this will have a negative environmental effect."

Are all of his clothes purchased from clothiers who stitch each garment by hand? This can get very very expensive very quickly, and isn't a viable option for some. If he's not doing that, he can shut up. Mass manufactured clothing of any kind is a Fast Fashion business model. This isn't some new thing since the rise of Shein and FashionNova it's been around for as long as clothing has been being mass manufactured. He would be hard-pressed to find ANYONE in his life that doesn't own at least one fast fashion item.

I do think it's best practice to avoid hoarding tons of ultra cheap clothing and splurge on fewer higher quality, better manufactured garments from more ethical brands. But for many people that is not affordable, or accessible. Your bf needs to get off his high horse and check his closet because I guarantee he has things in his closet that are fast-fashion, and he's just hopping on the hate bandwagon without fully understanding what fast fashion is."

Everyone is allowed to have their own boundaries. I just know that the few people I’ve met who are that drastic about things, they are not people I want to have around in my life :p

Life is a series of sequences and events and each event adds weight to our belief systems. Sometimes people are just incompatible and this may take years to manifest. 

Lastly my personal opinion is this is just sad because love or what it is supposed to be is compassionate and forgiving. Never demanding.

vegan,,Vegans should boycott the Fast Fashion industry,"The two causes are so interconnected. You have an industry that's built on the backs of exploiting workers in developing countries under poor conditions. It's also low barrier to entry since we already vote with our dollar on food and clothes we buy and need to extend it to fast fashion brands.

Here are some more reasons:

1. Environmental impact: Fast fashion is one of the most polluting industries globally, with high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, and waste generation. By reducing consumption and opting for sustainable and ethically sourced clothing, vegans can contribute to protecting the planet and its inhabitants.
2. Labor exploitation: Fast fashion relies on cheap labor, often in developing countries, where workers are subjected to long hours, low wages, and unsafe working conditions. As a vegan, supporting fair and ethical labor practices should be a priority.
3. Alternative options: There are several vegan and sustainable fashion brands that prioritize ethical and eco-friendly practices, offering high-quality and stylish alternatives to fast fashion. By choosing these options, vegans can align their values with their consumer choices.

Overall, boycotting fast fashion is a way for vegans to extend our commitment to animal welfare to other areas of their lives, contributing to a more compassionate and sustainable world.

I just don't believe it should be included under vegansim or seen as an expectation of vegans.

It's a bit like going to feminists ""include men too!"" And it kind of just dilutes the movement and what the message is about.

In this case, veganism is about the animals.

We can do better by going plastic free, zero waste, second hand clothing, ditch fast fashion, etc etc etc. But it shouldn't be part of veganism. There are other movements for these things specifically. 

...

My concern mainly is that by adding this idea that veganism includes not buying fast fashion, it would exclude many from the movement. And make it feel like there's too much involved = overwhelmed.

The poor can easily go vegan because plant based foods are often the cheapest globally. But... when it comes to clothes poor often rely on fast fashion because they can't afford better quality.

So absolutely we shouldn give up fast fashion if we can. But it shouldn't be an expectation of all vegans."

vegan,,Vegans should boycott the Fast Fashion industry,"The two causes are so interconnected. You have an industry that's built on the backs of exploiting workers in developing countries under poor conditions. It's also low barrier to entry since we already vote with our dollar on food and clothes we buy and need to extend it to fast fashion brands.

1. Environmental impact: Fast fashion is one of the most polluting industries globally, with high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, and waste generation. By reducing consumption and opting for sustainable and ethically sourced clothing, vegans can contribute to protecting the planet and its inhabitants.
2. Labor exploitation: Fast fashion relies on cheap labor, often in developing countries, where workers are subjected to long hours, low wages, and unsafe working conditions. As a vegan, supporting fair and ethical labor practices should be a priority.
3. Alternative options: There are several vegan and sustainable fashion brands that prioritize ethical and eco-friendly practices, offering high-quality and stylish alternatives to fast fashion. By choosing these options, vegans can align their values with their consumer choices.

Now, as a vegan, I understand not all vegans think like that and many have nuanced understandings. However, the hate in response to this post is quite alarming.

Edit: Great website for researching sustainable brands and also to discover fast fashion brands: https://goodonyou.eco/",2023,"This is generally true with some caveats, as other have mentioned: eg if you're poor and unable to reasonably obtain clothes another way. These are mostly the same caveats to veganism - it's not expected of you to bankrupt yourself in travel costs or work time missed to travel outside of your food desert if you live in one.

I think this point could be made a 'higher order' so to speak. The logic of carnism used by the animal ag industry is the same as any exploitative industry under capitalism, the difference being that animal agriculture has one the least concessions because animals cannot self advocate. To me it then follows that, parallel to carnism (as it is parallel to racism and other institutions of division and oppression), capitalism must be opposed as it's very logic is to be unethical in the pursuit of profits. Thus the 'higher order' point I would put is that everyone who agrees with the logical systems of veganism, should also agree with *a* system of anti-capitalist reformism or revolution.

I think this is a better way to put it because then we can have a principled stance on industries in general without wasting time describing and debating each one (although this is useful for outreach), and we can instead use the time to discuss what the best thing to do about it is.

I think the tacit implication of OP's post is that we should buy 'ethical' or second hand clothing. The first is expensive and often not possible for a population who have had their labour value stolen from them by their employer, and the second would not be so cheap if half of the inventory wasn't fast fashion, ie if fast fashion was dismantled without dismantling capitalism poor people would no longer have access to cheap second hand clothing."

Edit: Great website for researching sustainable brands and also to discover fast fashion brands: https://goodonyou.eco/",2023,"This is a more complicated issue than it seems. I'm not saying it's an unworthy cause - I don't necessarily disagree with you - but it can't be an expectation. Veganism can already be prohibitively expensive in certain areas, and this tends to be an argument people use against veganism. ""Well... if you care about the animals so much, then why aren't you doing x, x, and x...""

Completely avoiding fast fashion is a lot harder than just ""oh, don't shop at Shein or Forever 21,"" which have become easy to identify and point the finger at due to the rapidly shifting styles and low price point. However, there are a LOT more stores in the fast fashion business and it can be hard to even differentiate between which brands are or aren't at times. Price point alone isn't even a good indicator. Someone can think that buying a $60 shirt definitely can't be contributing to fast fashion because it's $60, but it isn't necessarily true. Boycotting fast fashion, if we were really getting into the nuts and bolts and researching every company on the shelves, would mean boycotting buying clothes in general. It would mean doing most purchasing online because very few brick and mortar stores carry 100% sustainable and ethically sourced clothing. 

Thrifting can reduce impact, but unfortunately now thrift stores are becoming overrun with these fast fashion pieces too, and the rise of people going ""hunting"" to resell items has driven up prices. It's harder to find quality items, and harder to get a deal. When I lived in Boston, for example, the Goodwill was more expensive than buying new clothes from the Walmart in my hometown in suburban MA... Recently, my local Savers had a Shein shirt that cost more than it had probably cost brand new on Shein. Speaking of thrifting... as a vegan, is it problematic to thrift clothing that is not vegan? I don't say this to incite you, because I don't know the answer either. 

Now I'm not saying it isn't worth cutting out some of the worst offenders. Every little bit helps. But I think a better tactic, aside from making your own clothes, is just being more selective about the pieces you are buying and reducing your consumerism as a whole. Ask yourself, ""is this just a trend? Will this still look good in 5 years? Do I really love it?"" 

If you are someone in a position to ONLY buy sustainable brands with proven ethical labor practices, and they make them in sizes that fit them and styles that you like, then do so. But I don't necessarily think it should be an expectation or qualifying factor of veganism. I like to think that most people who ascribe to the vegan lifestyle for the ethics are already trying their best to limit their impact in other areas. Our society really makes it impossible to be totally perfect."

It's also low barrier to entry since we already vote with our dollar on food and clothes we buy and need to extend it to fast fashion brands.

Here are some more reasons:

1. Environmental impact: Fast fashion is one of the most polluting industries globally, with high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, and waste generation. By reducing consumption and opting for sustainable and ethically sourced clothing, vegans can contribute to protecting the planet and its inhabitants.
2. Labor exploitation: Fast fashion relies on cheap labor, often in developing countries, where workers are subjected to long hours, low wages, and unsafe working conditions. As a vegan, supporting fair and ethical labor practices should be a priority.
3. Alternative options: There are several vegan and sustainable fashion brands that prioritize ethical and eco-friendly practices, offering high-quality and stylish alternatives to fast fashion. By choosing these options, vegans can align their values with their consumer choices.

Overall, boycotting fast fashion is a way for vegans to extend our commitment to animal welfare to other areas of their lives, contributing to a more compassionate and sustainable world.

malefashionadvice,Article,Putting fast fashion out of fashion,,2022,"One of the major problems with heritage clothing simply being reduced to an aesthetic was that many companies that emphasized ethical production along with long-term durability had their niche co-opted by companies that just exported their production abroad to murky supply lines. Companies like Alex Mills and many of the Huckberry brands exploited an opportunity and were able to undercut a bunch of really forward-thinking companies. Now that heritage is considered passe, we're seeing so-called streetwear and many other current styles place no emphasis on ethical production. I think it is really important that people re-discover the values that brought people to heritage in the first place."
malefashionadvice,Article,Putting fast fashion out of fashion,,2022,Is there a list of high quality sustainable brands that I can check on when considering my next purchase. Especially if they are available in Europe.
malefashionadvice,Article,Putting fast fashion out of fashion,,2022,"I've been saying this over and over again that I just don't believe that when it comes to male fashion, fast fashion is not driving mass growth in sales. The average man when given the option to buy cheaper clothes do not buy significantly more clothes, they spend less money on clothes. 

&#x200B;

[Look at the source article this article quoted](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/style-thats-sustainable-a-new-fast-fashion-formula) \- 

>The number of garments produced annually has doubled since 2000 and exceeded 100 billion for the first time in 2014: nearly 14 items of clothing for every person on earth

&#x200B;

14 items of clothing per person per year. To literally put that into perspective, last week I bought three pairs of socks and 2 pairs of underwear, that's more than half my ""share"" of clothing for the year already.....

&#x200B;

But let's dissect this number further - In 2000, the world population was 6.14 billion. In 2015, it was 7.43 billion. In 2000, 25% of the world lived in poverty (World bank definition of $1.90 inflation/purchasing power adjusted dollars a day), so 75% didn't live in poverty. This means that the non-poor population of the world in 2000 was 4.6 billion. In 2015, 12% of the world lived in poverty, so the non-poor population of the world was 6.54 billion. 

&#x200B;

I'm going to assume that people in extreme poverty aren't buying commercially produced clothing. They get hand me downs or self-produce (which technically does still consume cotton/wool, etc). Thus, per capital clothing consumption went up 41%. 

&#x200B;

Consider the following two factors now:

* What percentage of growth was driven by people barely above the poverty line getting richer? IE: if you went from making $2/day to $5/day, you rightfully should be consuming more. 
* What percentage of growth come from women?

&#x200B;

I don't have the data to prove it, but I'm willing to bet that the growth in clothing consumption is most likely driven by women and people getting lifted out of poverty. Not high-income individuals (of which all of us here count as) buying shit loads of clothing because it is cheaper."

You're paying for the brand, a literal label in most cases.

Do you know any such companies that are still around?"
malefashionadvice,Article,Putting fast fashion out of fashion,,2022,"I've always liked Patagonias vibe but don't own much because they're just so darn expensive. But I decided that the next couple years I'm going to make a concerted effort to collect some Patagonia items that I know I'll get my money's worth out of. I know not eveyone has the luxury of paying that much up front, but anyone who does should really consider seeking out similar brands. Otherwise they'll die off and we'll say ""that's so sad"" right before clicking 'buy now' on Amazon."
malefashionadvice,Article,Putting fast fashion out of fashion,,2022,The first step is to stop using buzzwords to describe clothing.
malefashionadvice,Article,Putting fast fashion out of fashion,,2022,"It's very hard to find easily accessible information on every brand. I'm no 100% sustainable and ethical buyer, however I look out for certain things. 

- Country of origin. If it's made in my country (UK) then I know workers of said manufacturer will (likely) be protected by our labour laws. Also when a company produces it's clothes in it's country of origin, it shows they care about oversight of the production process, i.e. quality. 

- Fabric. Pretty much always try to find natural fibres and avoid synthetics where possible. The fabric is dependant on what kind of clothing you're buying, but generally speaking aim to buy clothes made of cotton, wool, silk, linen, etc. Sometimes it's unavoidable, but do what you can. 

- Price. Understand what good products cost, is the price too good to be true? I know that I can buy a T-shirt that is 100% made in UK, with UK fabrics, of a great quality, for [£20](https://communityclothing.co.uk/collections/mens-t-shirts-tops/products/mensshortsleevet-shirt-white?variant=6978726854710). I also own a T-shirt from Primark, it's 100% cotton, probably around 180gsm and it's a solid T-shirt all around. It cost me £9, because they outsource production to third would countries. 

My go-to's when I know I want a solid, hard working piece of clothing are [Blacksmith](https://www.blacksmith-store.com/pages/our-values) and [Community Clothing](https://communityclothing.co.uk/). 

Still on the hunt for similar brands and retailers. To echo what's been said in this thread, buy used. I get the majority of my clothes used and it really opens you up to great quality at good prices that you know is doing good for the world by repurposing old clothing."

Overall, the final thesis of your comment seems to be mostly correct to me"
malefashionadvice,Article,Putting fast fashion out of fashion,,2022,"I was going to disagree with you so I was a dork and graphed [Adult male expenditure on apparel in the USA during the period 2006-2021](https://imgur.com/a/Vb55htW) from the Consumer Expenditure Survey and as it turns out, expenditures remained relatively steady (with the exception of a big drop during the pandemic). However, this is in contrast to the median household income increasing from [~$60k](https://www.bls.gov/cex/tables/calendar-year/mean/cu-all-multi-year-2006-2012.pdf) (pdf warning) to [~$87k](https://www.bls.gov/cex/tables/calendar-year/mean/cu-all-multi-year-2021.pdf) and inflation meaning [$1 in 2021 is effectively $1.47 in 2006](https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/2006?amount=1).

what is interesting to me is the social acceptability for a man and a woman to show up in the same clothes over and over, I believe a woman could be bullied for wearing the same stuff over and over while a man would probably not.

Zara is considered high-end fashion in my country. I remember those ""cool"" girls in high school flaunting basics from Zara only to personally find out the price and quality of fabric they use. I could buy the same basics for a way cheaper price and better quality. Zara was so hyped around 2009 to 2012 here, I didn't understand what the hype was all about. Maybe cause of the brand and that it was also well-known in Western countries that owning Zara clothes here made girls seem ""cool"" or ""rich"" even when it truly hurts their pockets."

What is its reputation in your country?",2022,"Regardless the purchasing power of the currencies in different countries, Zara is fast fashion by definition. It is owned by fast fashion giant Inditex. The process of making a garment from start (design) to finish (being hang in a store) is incredibly fast, and the collections move fast too, with new items coming in the stores weekly, following the most current trends. The clothing is made by poorly paid workers in developing countries. It makes sense for it to be perceived as high-end in countries where Zara (and Mango, H&M, ecc) are expensive, and probably is one of the few options for trendy clothing. But it is correct to call it fast fashion, because it simply is.

Edit: Regarding the reputation, when I was in Italy it was considered by older women a cheaper alternative to boutique clothing for like formal clothes for work (think of a 50 year old bank worker buying a blazer). It probably would have been perceived differently by younger girls!
In the Netherlands it was the most trendy store, with huge lines outside it during sale season. It didn't seem to be considered too expensive by most girls I knew, since lots of them shopped there. 
I personally always found it over priced for what it is."

What is its reputation in your country?",2022,"Spaniard here, I guess I can give an insight as to the reputation of Zara in its own home nation.

As you can imagine, it is quite a reputable brandname in the sense that it is one of Spain's most widely internationalized companies. His founder, Amancio Ortega, is known for being the richest national individual. With these premises, of course, a plethora of opinions arise, varying from those people who celebrate the company and its founder as a case of major success for the country, to those who denounce the company for labour abuses in delocalized factories around the world and Ortega himself as a tax evader.

However, I think your question has to do more with the clothing side of things, and, in this sense, I feel like it would be categorized in the middle as far as reputation goes: it's certainly not the cheapest, but it is also the main go-to store for many middle income families. Indeed, it's like the brand tries to give an impression of high end fashion at an accessible cost for people in the spectrum (and I say it's ""like"", because they are known for not spending anything in marketing, like, they never announce themselves or anything because people do already know what Zara is). But, as I was saying, they are by no means at the higher end of the fashion side of things, for which wealthier people would usually go to places such as Cortefiel and Massimo Dutti (both of which I think are owned by Zara itself, by the way).

Nevertheless, I think I understand where your question comes from; an old foreign classmate of mine once told me that Zara is much pricier elsewhere in the world than in Spain, which I found to be really curious - like, would they purposefully keep prices lower in its own nation out of special consideration? I don't know, hard to say for me; I haven't really ever gone to a Zara abroad, and they're definitely not my go-to clothing shop anyways.

Anyway, I hope this helps :)"

What is its reputation in your country?",2022,"The thing is, Zara really is inexpensive fast fashion but because we are so used to seeing crazy cheap fast fashion online brands everywhere and clothes are cheaper now than they EVER have been, it seems expensive by comparison. Which leads people to think it's can't be that bad, because it's much more costly than Shein and BooHoo et al, right? And it's a complex issue because many people that criticise these practices are branded elitists who want to take affordable options away from people on limited incomes. 

If you look back 500 years, clothes were so expensive that even rich people didn't have wardrobes like the average minimum wage person has today (purely in terms of number of outfits, not quality!). Over time clothes became cheaper as textile making became industrialised, the sewing machine was invented etc. In the 1930's a decent income for a man working full time in the US was about $30 a week. That would be something like a journalist or clerk, so many would have brought home much less. If you look at ads for clothes of the time, it was a much bigger proportion of that salary than we pay today for clothes. $10 would have been a typical amount to pay for a dress for example. 1/3 weekly salary for one garment is much more than the average person is willing to pay today.

So it's really our perspective on clothes that has changed. We aren't willing to spend what they should cost (in a fair responsible world) because society wants dirt cheap and practically disposable instead of high quality, long wearing and carefully purchased. Worth remembering that Zara is one of the fast fashion originators - previous to its rise fashion brands would release seasonal collections rather than fortnightly/weekly/daily releases like is done today. So there is a reason they are often name checked along with Shein when people talk about the worst offenders."

That's the core idea behind the fashion industry; since it's virtually impossible to make clothes that don't disintegrate immediately, but only last 2-3 months, they use cultural pressure to convince you that you need to throw away what you have an buy something new, because even if what you already have is still perfectly wearable, it's not *fashionable*, and thus becomes unusable regardless of its quality.

I read a rapport that stated the level of lead in the clothes (residue from dying process) was much, much higher than what consumer laws in the USA and EU recommend. 

Lead is a neurotoxin that can be absorbed by the skin. Children who are exposed to high levels of lead (whether in the womb or by wearing clothes) can suffer intellectual disabilities and behavioural disorders. Lead is also stored in our brains, kidneys, livers, teeth and bones. It's dangerous, basically. 

Before you can say ""oh but I wash my clothes"" - lead is literally being flushed into our water systems where it's difficult to remove. 

There's a reason why consumer laws state what level of lead our clothes can contain. I'm not going to toy with that. Ymmv."

Generally I think that structural issues need structural solutions and are not the responsibility of individuals, but I also get the frustration in seeing fast fashion proliferate. I guess the best solution would be to add pressure on quality brands to make bigger sizes in cuts that actually work on bodies... And overturn this neoliberal capitalism that makes fast fashion both possible and profitable.
 
My own solution to the intersection of fatness and relative poverty has been to try and learn sewing. To be fair, I'm not in a place where I would need to look ""professional"" or ""normal"" or ""credible"" so that gives a lot of freedom in terms of what I can wear, and clothes looking homemade isn't a problem. I've also got loads of time and few responsibilities so fiddling about with fabrics is doable.

I don't know how true this next part is, but someone on Reddit said that those brands aren't even making a profit on the clothing, they're profiting off selling your data to advertising firms. 

And I do get it about the price. I've also fallen victim to the siren song of a $10 dress. But the thing is, the shit is bad. Real bad. The fabric is always some bizarre plastic-y monstrosity that feels gross on my skin. The pieces always pull in weird places, or are way too big in one area but way too small in another. When I have bought something from there I could actually wear, I typically wear it once and never again. 

What I also don't understand is this narrative I see around plus size spaces that ""there is literally nowhere else to get things that cheap."" But all retailers, even high end ones, have clearance sections. More and more plus size thrift stores are popping up online. I also am of the philosophy that I would rather have fewer things that are high quality than a lot of things that are shitty. But not everyone is like that."

I am privileged that I am a size 18/20 so I can generally find stuff that fits in thrift stores and I can afford to buy from small slow fashion boutiques on occasion. 
I don’t do fast fashion for the environmental impact and the human rights abuses are abhorrent.
I use thredUP a lot as it’s easier for me to shop for clothes that are in my size range with a bigger selection than I’d find at the thrift store. It’s nice to be able to filter by material type as I refuse to wear polyester.

I think the biggest thing for me though is that I also mend my clothes a lot. I refuse to throw out clothes that can be fixed. I use a darning loom to fix socks, I use the sashiko method to sew up thigh holes in jeans. I dye faded or stained clothes or use dye to change the look of an item I’m not wearing anymore to make me reach for it more.

Just spending that money per month (or as needed, I don't use them every month) and supplementing with occasional purchases for staples like jeans, underwear, etc. is OK for me. I don't think someone purchasing from Shein a few times a year because that may be the only way they can find something cute/fashionable in their size for a reasonable price is actually the issue, either.  Someone on here already said it, ""having principles costs money"". What I do have a problem with (other than the problem inherently being with Shein and its unfair labor practices) is people, plus-sized or not, ordering weekly hauls from these type of sites and buying into micro-trends . There's a big difference between ordering 3-4 times a year and 3-4 times a month. Anytime I see a Youtuber/TikToker do this I immediately unfollow."

I don't know, am I being too harsh? Would love to have a discussion with everyone here about it.",2023,"I agree with you so much. I think that sometimes we see the way that straight sized people are able to consume fashion (can always find stuff in their size, can find stuff that is temporary trends, can get a lot of thrifted stuff) and we want that too. Shein and Temu has been able to give us fat women the same sort of overabundance that thin women get all the time when they go thrifting or shopping at the mall.   


But here's the thing, that type of shopping is bad for everyone. It's bad for the environment and for the workers, but it is also bad for us as humans. We don't appreciate our clothes or take the time to mend and clean them properly (because it only cost $10 to begin with!). We don't know how to find clothes that really fit us because we only get exposed to cheap material that is stretchy so they don't have to worry about getting a proper fit. We need MORE. More closet space for the clothes we buy in amounts far larger than our grandparents did because it is cheap. We don't develop a distinct style because we just buy trends on sale and then move on to the next one when the clothes start falling apart.  


I am guilty of buying a dress because I want the serotonin hit of buying something new and it is sooooo cute. But I'm working on it. I personally don't use SHEIN or TEMU because I think their quality is terrible and their stuff has never fit me, but I'm still guilty of overconsuming because stuff is cheap. I might be buying from Target instead of SHEIN but it is still bad for the environment and workers and me. But now I'm taking time to not do this anymore. I have learnt sewing and mending so I can care for my clothes. I learned proper stain removal and washing care, and when I can't remove a stain I now over it with embroidery. That's the key. Pay what you can for high quality clothing and then care for it as long as you can. If the highest quality clothing you can afford is SHEIN then so be it, but wear it into the ground."

To be fair I’m still shopping at Old Navy, Target, etc - but it’s been made clear to me that there’s a substantial difference between the harm caused by Shein vs the harm caused by other fast fashion/cheaper corporate brands. Even then I’m trying to reduce those purchases or get them secondhand where I can. 

Plus size women deserve better - that’s a given. And obviously straight size individuals are a huge reason Shein exists bc they love cheap trendy clothes as much as plus size people do. We just have the extra layer of having significantly less options. To me personally I don’t think that’s a good enough excuse to support a terrible company like Shein. 

It’s not even like they treat their customers well, either. Didn’t their clothes have high levels of lead? Or might still? I can’t remember. And a (straight sized) friend of mine ordered some dresses from Shein and 2 of the 3 arrived with broken straps. The product you end up with at the end often isn’t worth even the little bit of money you spend to get it."

Trying to find plus sized clothing in second hand stores here in nz is also really hard to find, not to mention the lack of a car and the extreme cost of living here. 

I get the sentiment but I'm buying what I can afford.  If I do find second hand clothes I will change it up and add things to it, but f**k me you need to be rich to sew your own clothes in NZ too. Hence why I don't sew my own clothes, the cost is astronomical. If it were cheaper than I would absolutely buy from more ethical stores, I just can't  justify buying $160 plus size jeans or pay my rent.  

It's unfortunate, but when I do find the time and money go thrifting, most of the plus size.clothing are from shien or the likes of them anyway. I'd hate for someone to think badly about my outfits because I buy thrifted shien items.

Almost all my clothes I have had for years. I have things I wore in high school and I’m 34. I’ve shopped on Shein like twice. Two years later and I still have and wear the stuff I bought. The only time I buy new clothes is when they literally fall apart (I’m talking years and years of use) or my weight fluctuates.

I feel I’ve been conditioned my whole life to be ashamed of my body and to think that looking good and having confidence in my appearance would simply not be a possibility for me, but fast fashion has changed that. To add, I live two hours away from any town with shops, and I might spend a whole day driving to a town and from shop to shop to try things on and still not find anything that fits or is affordable to me.

Shein is helping me learn about my sense of style affordably, and once I’ve worn my favorite items to death I plan to replace them with high quality, sustainable versions from other companies.
In the meantime, I’m extremely careful about reading reviews and product descriptions to make sure the fit and material will be to my liking so I avoid getting things I’ll never wear or will return/discard. 

Unfortunately my shame has shifted from being about my body to being about where I get my clothes. I don’t tell people irl that I buy from Shein. I know I’m probably just rationalizing here, but I’m tired of being responsible for corporations’ bad behavior. This whole situation really sucks."

You're very wrong if you think that the boohoo group (and competitors) work on small margins. Margins for almost all items are in excess of 50%, unheard of in most other industries.

The thing that is killing them recently is international shipping and increased logistics costs across the world, as well as much higher returns than expected.

For example, returns for dresses are in excess of 50%. This is because lots of women have very different body shapes and styles, and it's almost impossible to cater for everyone with one size. The manufacturers' quality has also decreased in the last couple of years, so it's a double-edged sword considering dresses make up the most of their sales. 

Since covid, international distribution costs have increased by more than threefold - this massively impacts profit. the USA was a very good and fast-growing sector for them before and during covid, and this has also reduced due to places like shein offering quicker and lower shipping costs. This should be mitigated soon when they open US distribution centres. 

To answer your actual question, no I highly doubt it will harm them at all. People need clothes, and they will look for the cheapest available. The UK market will likely increase over the next year, but international will likely fall."

videos,,Fast Fashion Is Hot Garbage | Climate Town,,2021,"\>worn 7 times before being thrown out

\>purchase 67 pieces of clothing a year

Who are these people? Why are they doing this? It boggles my god damn mind.

My wife and I both still wear clothes that we've had since high school (as long as they still fit... not all do...), and we're in our mid to late 30s! Hell she has clothes from her mother back in the 60s and 70s!

And it's not like we made the choice together, or like we bonded over this shit. It was just incidental. That's what we've always done and it's only hearing shit like this that makes me scratch my head going ""WHO... WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE!?""

Thing is I think I know who they are.

My wife and I take nightly walks through our neighborhood. And when we lived in Florida (we recently moved out of state) we noticed something on garbage night.

See, garbage in our city in SoFla was picked up twice a week, with recycling on only 1 of those 2 days. Thing is we never put our garbage out both days because there wasn't enough to take out. And mind you we lived 3 and 4 people to the house (so normal family size) depending on which year it was and what roommates we had at the time. We probably took out our garbage once every other week.

But when we go on walks... a large majority of our neighbors had garbage out every single time it was garbage night. And not only that... it would be overflowing.

And we would be confused...

""WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? What are they doing to create so much garbage?""

Like it's not like I try to NOT create garbage. I'm just a regular old dude, doing regular old things. Hell... it wasn't until my mid twenties that I started recycling because a girl I dated yelled at me for not recycling. And I was like ""huh... never really thought to"" cause I was just... some 20 something year old dude who wasn't thinking past his own nose.

And this is why it confuses me.

I'm no hippy. I'm not tree hugging save the earth type. I eat taco bell, drink mtn dew, smoked cigarettes most of my life (I did quit that... I figured I survived this long might as well stop doing that shit). Hell sometimes I still throw cans in the garbage cause I missed my throw and it bounced in and I'm just like ""eh, where it lands, it stays"".

So... if my lazy, filthy, dumbass who can't be fucked to sort his garbage correctly isn't purchasing 67 pieces of clothing a year and not creating 2 overflowing garbage cans of garbage a week (which I presume contains these clothes). And I'm not alone because my wife, my roommates in the past, my friends... we don't do this.

So, I want to know...

WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE!?

\[edit\] - some how got my mind mixed up towards the end and saying throwing out 67 pieces of clothes... fixed that"

Also support the idea of corporations being taxed for everything they produce that is harmful for the planet. Use that tax money to clean the planet. Learn from history how corporations pushed [""made to break"" products](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2006/05/origins-anti-litter-campaigns/) so that people keep buying new stuff and then pushed the responsibility of recycling onto consumers instead of big businesses.

There is this overwhelming belief in the UK that only wealthy people would ever 'waste their money' buying something that isnt the cheapest possible option and they're total idiots for doing so and that there is no difference between a £2.50 pair of jeans and a £80 pair of jeans. I know people who will talk to the cows come home about how we should do more about climate change and then go on about how the wealthy are scum for buying clothes from anywhere that isnt Primark.

You dont need to shop at Gucci to buy items that aren't exploiting people and made from plastics, actually I wouldn't be surprised if the big Italian and French brands are also just as guilty, there are plenty of smaller brands based in the UK, US, wherever you live who are making things relatively locally and without ruining everything.

femalefashionadvice,,What I learned working in fast fashion eCommerce marketing,"I worked in marketing for fast fashion ecommerce brands over the past few years. I’ve since switched industries but figured that behind the scenes knowledge could be interesting for some. A bit of a disclaimer: please note that my experiences are just that. My experiences. So they may not necessarily apply to _every_ brand out there.

------------



**Catalog Images Always Use Clips**

Last year, [ASOS faced some heat](https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/25/asos-slammed-after-being-caught-out-using-clips-on-models-dress-9318265/) when they accidentally uploaded a catalog image that showed the garment being clipped on the model. This practice is the standard across eCommerce catalog shooting. The actual reason isn’t to mislead the customer (although that is unfortunately the outcome) but it’s due to the nature of the eCommerce new arrival cycle.

Typically, company HQ only receives 1 or maybe 2 samples of every item that they can use to photograph for catalog and campaign images. These samples arrive much earlier than bulk stock in order to be photographed ahead of release, and when bulk stock is finally ready, it goes straight to warehouses or retail stores in order to save on shipping costs. Brands tend to rotate through different models who have different heights, weights, and sizes - which means they’re often too small for the sample size. Without clips, the garment will usually look too baggy or loose and will not reflect the true fitting of the item so stylists clip the item on the body then photoshop them out during retouching.

That said, it’s a bit of a hard line to draw. Sometimes stylists clip it too tightly or too loosely (only designers really know how it’s supposed to fit and they aren’t usually involved in the photoshoot process) and the result can be misleading. 

------------------


**Every Influencer Post Is An Advertisement**

If an influencer tags a brand in their photo or in their caption, they most likely were paid to do so (either via cash or via free clothing). I know this isn’t necessarily ground-breaking news, but I want to explain the depth of the system.

Most brands have influencers on rotation. One of my previous companies had 150+ each month who they would send X articles of clothing and/or cash (depends on the influencer’s follower count and country) in return for Y number of posts or Stories (sometimes we would write the caption for them). We would track engagement and clothing sales spikes to see if it was worth it to keep them on. On our roster, we purposefully would have anyone from large scale celebrities down to micro-influencers (girls with less than 2k followers but had high engagement who had potential to grow - think popular university students) and everyone in between. Only influencers who were just starting out would post for us without us giving them anything for free because they wanted to align to our brand. Over 10k followers, never. 

So yes, it is great that Instagram rolled out the “Paid Partnership” feature that makes it easier to tell what is an ad or what isn’t. But it’s actually in both the brand and the influencer’s interest to avoid the Paid Partnership feature. Brands want the posts to seem organic (it’s not cool to have to pay to be featured) and influencers do not want their feed to be solely advertisements (it’s not cool to be a sell out). Influencers will mainly choose to do Paid Partnerships if the company isn’t good for their image or if the company has a lot of cash to spare.

This, I suspect, is why Instagram is getting rid of public like figures. If you do a Paid Partnership post, the influencer grants the brand access to the data metrics (how many likes, how many people saw it, etc;) which they desperately need to track in order to determine ROI. Furthermore, Paid Partnership posts also allow brands to put money behind the post and boost it as an ad that appears organic. It’s effectively another cash grab from IG.  But both brands and influencers will continue to skirt these regardless.

-----------------


**Everyone Copies Everyone… and Korea**

Brands I worked for used [WGSN](https://www.wgsn.com/en/) for trend forecasting from runways and I know majority of others do as well. They basically collate all of high fashion’s runways into a few distilled core trends per season. This is why sometimes you’ll see campaigns that are very similar from a number of brands at the same time. 

Competitor analysis is very, very real. Brands scrape competitor websites to figure out their inventory and determine if they have any gaps themselves. It is not uncommon to just straight up buy another brand’s garment and copy the pattern with slight adjustments.

This is particularly true when it comes to Dongdaemun, Seoul’s largest wholesale market. Lots of brands will either use patterns based off their inventory. Many others will actually just mark up, white label, and resell Korean wholesale market clothing. This is the case for Pixie Market (with the exception of their Made by Pixie Market section). Oh and those cheap accessories you see on fast fashion brands? Almost all of them are from Guangzhou in China.

--------------


**Greenwashing is Real**

If a fast fashion company is coming out with a CSR line, it’s not because they care about the environment. It’s because their PR department told them it was a great idea to combat any claims of them not being eco-friendly. And it’s because their merchandisers told them it was a great idea to jump on consumer trends.

That’s not to say CSR collections are bad. By buying them, you are encouraging the brand to continue to develop them. But unless environmental sustainability and fair labour are embedded within the brand’s DNA from its onset, it is most likely just a marketing ploy. The same can be said for inclusivity campaigns and banning retouching (you mean we can lay off our retouch team AND look woke? win fucking win).  

It’s worth noting that majority of brands share Asia factories with one another and conditions vary. China’s factory conditions have actually improved significantly over the years, so as a result, a lot of companies are migrated to places like Cambodia where conditions are more lenient and labor is cheaper - so be mindful of those labels.

**Catalog Images Always Use Clips**

Last year, [ASOS faced some heat](https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/25/asos-slammed-after-being-caught-out-using-clips-on-models-dress-9318265/) when they accidentally uploaded a catalog image that showed the garment being clipped on the model. This practice is the standard across eCommerce catalog shooting. The actual reason isn’t to mislead the customer (although that is unfortunately the outcome) but it’s due to the nature of the eCommerce new arrival cycle.

Typically, company HQ only receives 1 or maybe 2 samples of every item that they can use to photograph for catalog and campaign images. These samples arrive much earlier than bulk stock in order to be photographed ahead of release, and when bulk stock is finally ready, it goes straight to warehouses or retail stores in order to save on shipping costs. Brands tend to rotate through different models who have different heights, weights, and sizes - which means they’re often too small for the sample size. Without clips, the garment will usually look too baggy or loose and will not reflect the true fitting of the item so stylists clip the item on the body then photoshop them out during retouching.

That said, it’s a bit of a hard line to draw. Sometimes stylists clip it too tightly or too loosely (only designers really know how it’s supposed to fit and they aren’t usually involved in the photoshoot process) and the result can be misleading. 

------------------


**Every Influencer Post Is An Advertisement**

If an influencer tags a brand in their photo or in their caption, they most likely were paid to do so (either via cash or via free clothing). I know this isn’t necessarily ground-breaking news, but I want to explain the depth of the system.

Most brands have influencers on rotation. One of my previous companies had 150+ each month who they would send X articles of clothing and/or cash (depends on the influencer’s follower count and country) in return for Y number of posts or Stories (sometimes we would write the caption for them). We would track engagement and clothing sales spikes to see if it was worth it to keep them on. On our roster, we purposefully would have anyone from large scale celebrities down to micro-influencers (girls with less than 2k followers but had high engagement who had potential to grow - think popular university students) and everyone in between. Only influencers who were just starting out would post for us without us giving them anything for free because they wanted to align to our brand. Over 10k followers, never. 

So yes, it is great that Instagram rolled out the “Paid Partnership” feature that makes it easier to tell what is an ad or what isn’t. But it’s actually in both the brand and the influencer’s interest to avoid the Paid Partnership feature. Brands want the posts to seem organic (it’s not cool to have to pay to be featured) and influencers do not want their feed to be solely advertisements (it’s not cool to be a sell out). Influencers will mainly choose to do Paid Partnerships if the company isn’t good for their image or if the company has a lot of cash to spare.

This, I suspect, is why Instagram is getting rid of public like figures. If you do a Paid Partnership post, the influencer grants the brand access to the data metrics (how many likes, how many people saw it, etc;) which they desperately need to track in order to determine ROI. Furthermore, Paid Partnership posts also allow brands to put money behind the post and boost it as an ad that appears organic. It’s effectively another cash grab from IG.  But both brands and influencers will continue to skirt these regardless.

-----------------


**Everyone Copies Everyone… and Korea**

Brands I worked for used [WGSN](https://www.wgsn.com/en/) for trend forecasting from runways and I know majority of others do as well. They basically collate all of high fashion’s runways into a few distilled core trends per season. This is why sometimes you’ll see campaigns that are very similar from a number of brands at the same time. 

Competitor analysis is very, very real. Brands scrape competitor websites to figure out their inventory and determine if they have any gaps themselves. It is not uncommon to just straight up buy another brand’s garment and copy the pattern with slight adjustments.

This is particularly true when it comes to Dongdaemun, Seoul’s largest wholesale market. Lots of brands will either use patterns based off their inventory. Many others will actually just mark up, white label, and resell Korean wholesale market clothing. This is the case for Pixie Market (with the exception of their Made by Pixie Market section). Oh and those cheap accessories you see on fast fashion brands? Almost all of them are from Guangzhou in China.

--------------


**Greenwashing is Real**

If a fast fashion company is coming out with a CSR line, it’s not because they care about the environment. It’s because their PR department told them it was a great idea to combat any claims of them not being eco-friendly. And it’s because their merchandisers told them it was a great idea to jump on consumer trends.

That’s not to say CSR collections are bad. By buying them, you are encouraging the brand to continue to develop them. But unless environmental sustainability and fair labour are embedded within the brand’s DNA from its onset, it is most likely just a marketing ploy. The same can be said for inclusivity campaigns and banning retouching (you mean we can lay off our retouch team AND look woke? win fucking win).  

It’s worth noting that majority of brands share Asia factories with one another and conditions vary. China’s factory conditions have actually improved significantly over the years, so as a result, a lot of companies are migrated to places like Cambodia where conditions are more lenient and labor is cheaper - so be mindful of those labels. 

For what it's worth, I met a guy who works for an IGO in their fair labor division where his job was to raid clothing factories for inspection. He told me that Inditex was one of the better ones but that H&M and Uniqlo had by far the worst.

I do have a question for you. When I was studying fashion merchandising years ago, we had access to a trend forecasting site that was SO fun to dig around on and felt very diverse. You mentioned trend forecasting. Do you believe that the online presence has effected trend forecasting? What does it look like now for fast fashion specifically? It seemed to be such a routine system laid out for months, even for fast fashion, but now with trends popping up left and right online is it harder to forecast or perhaps “control” the trends? 

Over the years, I’ve become frustrated with how saturated the market is with trends. Especially in fast fashion. I felt as though I was walking into the same 5 stores with near identical assortments. This has pushed me to buy online much more because I can find unique silhouettes and patterns. Which feels like I’m betraying my own industry being a brick and mortar employee. It’s such a viscous cycle! 

Another question, what do you think of the small boutiques that pop up online? I have to admit that IG clothing ads get me maybe 60% of the time."

China’s factory conditions have actually improved significantly over the years, so as a result, a lot of companies are migrated to places like Cambodia where conditions are more lenient and labor is cheaper - so be mindful of those labels. 

For what it's worth, I met a guy who works for an IGO in their fair labor division where his job was to raid clothing factories for inspection. He told me that Inditex was one of the better ones but that H&M and Uniqlo had by far the worst.

**Catalog Images Always Use Clips**

Last year, [ASOS faced some heat](https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/25/asos-slammed-after-being-caught-out-using-clips-on-models-dress-9318265/) when they accidentally uploaded a catalog image that showed the garment being clipped on the model. This practice is the standard across eCommerce catalog shooting. The actual reason isn’t to mislead the customer (although that is unfortunately the outcome) but it’s due to the nature of the eCommerce new arrival cycle.

Typically, company HQ only receives 1 or maybe 2 samples of every item that they can use to photograph for catalog and campaign images. These samples arrive much earlier than bulk stock in order to be photographed ahead of release, and when bulk stock is finally ready, it goes straight to warehouses or retail stores in order to save on shipping costs. Brands tend to rotate through different models who have different heights, weights, and sizes - which means they’re often too small for the sample size. Without clips, the garment will usually look too baggy or loose and will not reflect the true fitting of the item so stylists clip the item on the body then photoshop them out during retouching.

That said, it’s a bit of a hard line to draw. Sometimes stylists clip it too tightly or too loosely (only designers really know how it’s supposed to fit and they aren’t usually involved in the photoshoot process) and the result can be misleading. 

------------------


**Every Influencer Post Is An Advertisement**

If an influencer tags a brand in their photo or in their caption, they most likely were paid to do so (either via cash or via free clothing). I know this isn’t necessarily ground-breaking news, but I want to explain the depth of the system.

Most brands have influencers on rotation. One of my previous companies had 150+ each month who they would send X articles of clothing and/or cash (depends on the influencer’s follower count and country) in return for Y number of posts or Stories (sometimes we would write the caption for them). We would track engagement and clothing sales spikes to see if it was worth it to keep them on. On our roster, we purposefully would have anyone from large scale celebrities down to micro-influencers (girls with less than 2k followers but had high engagement who had potential to grow - think popular university students) and everyone in between. Only influencers who were just starting out would post for us without us giving them anything for free because they wanted to align to our brand. Over 10k followers, never. 

So yes, it is great that Instagram rolled out the “Paid Partnership” feature that makes it easier to tell what is an ad or what isn’t. But it’s actually in both the brand and the influencer’s interest to avoid the Paid Partnership feature. Brands want the posts to seem organic (it’s not cool to have to pay to be featured) and influencers do not want their feed to be solely advertisements (it’s not cool to be a sell out). Influencers will mainly choose to do Paid Partnerships if the company isn’t good for their image or if the company has a lot of cash to spare.

This, I suspect, is why Instagram is getting rid of public like figures. If you do a Paid Partnership post, the influencer grants the brand access to the data metrics (how many likes, how many people saw it, etc;) which they desperately need to track in order to determine ROI. Furthermore, Paid Partnership posts also allow brands to put money behind the post and boost it as an ad that appears organic. It’s effectively another cash grab from IG.  But both brands and influencers will continue to skirt these regardless.

**Everyone Copies Everyone… and Korea**

Brands I worked for used [WGSN](https://www.wgsn.com/en/) for trend forecasting from runways and I know majority of others do as well. They basically collate all of high fashion’s runways into a few distilled core trends per season. This is why sometimes you’ll see campaigns that are very similar from a number of brands at the same time. 

Competitor analysis is very, very real. Brands scrape competitor websites to figure out their inventory and determine if they have any gaps themselves. It is not uncommon to just straight up buy another brand’s garment and copy the pattern with slight adjustments.

This is particularly true when it comes to Dongdaemun, Seoul’s largest wholesale market. Lots of brands will either use patterns based off their inventory. Many others will actually just mark up, white label, and resell Korean wholesale market clothing. This is the case for Pixie Market (with the exception of their Made by Pixie Market section). Oh and those cheap accessories you see on fast fashion brands? Almost all of them are from Guangzhou in China.

--------------


**Greenwashing is Real**

If a fast fashion company is coming out with a CSR line, it’s not because they care about the environment. It’s because their PR department told them it was a great idea to combat any claims of them not being eco-friendly. And it’s because their merchandisers told them it was a great idea to jump on consumer trends.

That’s not to say CSR collections are bad. By buying them, you are encouraging the brand to continue to develop them. But unless environmental sustainability and fair labour are embedded within the brand’s DNA from its onset, it is most likely just a marketing ploy. The same can be said for inclusivity campaigns and banning retouching (you mean we can lay off our retouch team AND look woke? win fucking win).  

It’s worth noting that majority of brands share Asia factories with one another and conditions vary. China’s factory conditions have actually improved significantly over the years, so as a result, a lot of companies are migrated to places like Cambodia where conditions are more lenient and labor is cheaper - so be mindful of those labels.

I’m just a regular ole consumer but I’ve known this for years, and am glad that my assumptions are correct. 

People like to shit on Asian online marketplaces for making “rip offs” of fast fashion items, but are they really rip offs of the item if it’s being made there anyways?? You’re just buying the item directly from the Chinese manufacturer instead of Topshop, H&M, Zara, etc.

The image search on the AE app is amazing. Save a picture of practically any fast fashion item (ESPECIALLY accessories), and I guarantee you will find it on AliExpress for way cheaper. 

This may be a controversial opinion here but guess what, a lot of luxury brands have their items assembled or sourced from China as well. 

I watched a documentary on YouTube a couple of days ago where journalists discovered that MaxMara furs were sourced from China and the people skinning the animals were being paid about 30 USD *a day*. 

Your luxury Gucci or LV bag is assembled in China too. The last couple of steps that take place in some European country are the reason why luxury bags can say “made in France/Spain/Italy”...but they’re still mainly assembled & manufactured in China.

EDIT: [Documentary about MaxMara & other luxury brands being sourced from China](https://youtu.be/n7hzomuDEIk)"

Furthermore, Paid Partnership posts also allow brands to put money behind the post and boost it as an ad that appears organic. It’s effectively another cash grab from IG.  But both brands and influencers will continue to skirt these regardless.

**Everyone Copies Everyone… and Korea**

Brands I worked for used [WGSN](https://www.wgsn.com/en/) for trend forecasting from runways and I know majority of others do as well. They basically collate all of high fashion’s runways into a few distilled core trends per season. This is why sometimes you’ll see campaigns that are very similar from a number of brands at the same time. 

Competitor analysis is very, very real. Brands scrape competitor websites to figure out their inventory and determine if they have any gaps themselves. It is not uncommon to just straight up buy another brand’s garment and copy the pattern with slight adjustments.

This is particularly true when it comes to Dongdaemun, Seoul’s largest wholesale market. Lots of brands will either use patterns based off their inventory. Many others will actually just mark up, white label, and resell Korean wholesale market clothing. This is the case for Pixie Market (with the exception of their Made by Pixie Market section). Oh and those cheap accessories you see on fast fashion brands? Almost all of them are from Guangzhou in China.

**Greenwashing is Real**

If a fast fashion company is coming out with a CSR line, it’s not because they care about the environment. It’s because their PR department told them it was a great idea to combat any claims of them not being eco-friendly. And it’s because their merchandisers told them it was a great idea to jump on consumer trends.

That’s not to say CSR collections are bad. By buying them, you are encouraging the brand to continue to develop them. But unless environmental sustainability and fair labour are embedded within the brand’s DNA from its onset, it is most likely just a marketing ploy. The same can be said for inclusivity campaigns and banning retouching (you mean we can lay off our retouch team AND look woke? win fucking win).  

It’s worth noting that majority of brands share Asia factories with one another and conditions vary. China’s factory conditions have actually improved significantly over the years, so as a result, a lot of companies are migrated to places like Cambodia where conditions are more lenient and labor is cheaper - so be mindful of those labels. 

For what it's worth, I met a guy who works for an IGO in their fair labor division where his job was to raid clothing factories for inspection. He told me that Inditex was one of the better ones but that H&M and Uniqlo had by far the worst.

**Catalog Images Always Use Clips**

Last year, [ASOS faced some heat](https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/25/asos-slammed-after-being-caught-out-using-clips-on-models-dress-9318265/) when they accidentally uploaded a catalog image that showed the garment being clipped on the model. This practice is the standard across eCommerce catalog shooting. The actual reason isn’t to mislead the customer (although that is unfortunately the outcome) but it’s due to the nature of the eCommerce new arrival cycle.

Typically, company HQ only receives 1 or maybe 2 samples of every item that they can use to photograph for catalog and campaign images. These samples arrive much earlier than bulk stock in order to be photographed ahead of release, and when bulk stock is finally ready, it goes straight to warehouses or retail stores in order to save on shipping costs. Brands tend to rotate through different models who have different heights, weights, and sizes - which means they’re often too small for the sample size. Without clips, the garment will usually look too baggy or loose and will not reflect the true fitting of the item so stylists clip the item on the body then photoshop them out during retouching.

That said, it’s a bit of a hard line to draw. Sometimes stylists clip it too tightly or too loosely (only designers really know how it’s supposed to fit and they aren’t usually involved in the photoshoot process) and the result can be misleading. 

------------------


**Every Influencer Post Is An Advertisement**

If an influencer tags a brand in their photo or in their caption, they most likely were paid to do so (either via cash or via free clothing). I know this isn’t necessarily ground-breaking news, but I want to explain the depth of the system.

Most brands have influencers on rotation. One of my previous companies had 150+ each month who they would send X articles of clothing and/or cash (depends on the influencer’s follower count and country) in return for Y number of posts or Stories (sometimes we would write the caption for them). We would track engagement and clothing sales spikes to see if it was worth it to keep them on. On our roster, we purposefully would have anyone from large scale celebrities down to micro-influencers (girls with less than 2k followers but had high engagement who had potential to grow - think popular university students) and everyone in between. Only influencers who were just starting out would post for us without us giving them anything for free because they wanted to align to our brand. Over 10k followers, never. 

So yes, it is great that Instagram rolled out the “Paid Partnership” feature that makes it easier to tell what is an ad or what isn’t. But it’s actually in both the brand and the influencer’s interest to avoid the Paid Partnership feature. Brands want the posts to seem organic (it’s not cool to have to pay to be featured) and influencers do not want their feed to be solely advertisements (it’s not cool to be a sell out). Influencers will mainly choose to do Paid Partnerships if the company isn’t good for their image or if the company has a lot of cash to spare.

This, I suspect, is why Instagram is getting rid of public like figures. If you do a Paid Partnership post, the influencer grants the brand access to the data metrics (how many likes, how many people saw it, etc;) which they desperately need to track in order to determine ROI. Furthermore, Paid Partnership posts also allow brands to put money behind the post and boost it as an ad that appears organic. It’s effectively another cash grab from IG.

Influencers will mainly choose to do Paid Partnerships if the company isn’t good for their image or if the company has a lot of cash to spare.

This, I suspect, is why Instagram is getting rid of public like figures. If you do a Paid Partnership post, the influencer grants the brand access to the data metrics (how many likes, how many people saw it, etc;) which they desperately need to track in order to determine ROI. Furthermore, Paid Partnership posts also allow brands to put money behind the post and boost it as an ad that appears organic. It’s effectively another cash grab from IG.  But both brands and influencers will continue to skirt these regardless.

**Everyone Copies Everyone… and Korea**

Brands I worked for used [WGSN](https://www.wgsn.com/en/) for trend forecasting from runways and I know majority of others do as well. They basically collate all of high fashion’s runways into a few distilled core trends per season. This is why sometimes you’ll see campaigns that are very similar from a number of brands at the same time. 

Competitor analysis is very, very real. Brands scrape competitor websites to figure out their inventory and determine if they have any gaps themselves. It is not uncommon to just straight up buy another brand’s garment and copy the pattern with slight adjustments.

This is particularly true when it comes to Dongdaemun, Seoul’s largest wholesale market. Lots of brands will either use patterns based off their inventory. Many others will actually just mark up, white label, and resell Korean wholesale market clothing. This is the case for Pixie Market (with the exception of their Made by Pixie Market section). Oh and those cheap accessories you see on fast fashion brands? Almost all of them are from Guangzhou in China.

**Greenwashing is Real**

If a fast fashion company is coming out with a CSR line, it’s not because they care about the environment. It’s because their PR department told them it was a great idea to combat any claims of them not being eco-friendly. And it’s because their merchandisers told them it was a great idea to jump on consumer trends.

That’s not to say CSR collections are bad. By buying them, you are encouraging the brand to continue to develop them. But unless environmental sustainability and fair labour are embedded within the brand’s DNA from its onset, it is most likely just a marketing ploy. The same can be said for inclusivity campaigns and banning retouching (you mean we can lay off our retouch team AND look woke? win fucking win).  

It’s worth noting that majority of brands share Asia factories with one another and conditions vary. China’s factory conditions have actually improved significantly over the years, so as a result, a lot of companies are migrated to places like Cambodia where conditions are more lenient and labor is cheaper - so be mindful of those labels. 

For what it's worth, I met a guy who works for an IGO in their fair labor division where his job was to raid clothing factories for inspection. He told me that Inditex was one of the better ones but that H&M and Uniqlo had by far the worst.

**Catalog Images Always Use Clips**

Last year, [ASOS faced some heat](https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/25/asos-slammed-after-being-caught-out-using-clips-on-models-dress-9318265/) when they accidentally uploaded a catalog image that showed the garment being clipped on the model. This practice is the standard across eCommerce catalog shooting. The actual reason isn’t to mislead the customer (although that is unfortunately the outcome) but it’s due to the nature of the eCommerce new arrival cycle.

Typically, company HQ only receives 1 or maybe 2 samples of every item that they can use to photograph for catalog and campaign images. These samples arrive much earlier than bulk stock in order to be photographed ahead of release, and when bulk stock is finally ready, it goes straight to warehouses or retail stores in order to save on shipping costs. Brands tend to rotate through different models who have different heights, weights, and sizes - which means they’re often too small for the sample size. Without clips, the garment will usually look too baggy or loose and will not reflect the true fitting of the item so stylists clip the item on the body then photoshop them out during retouching.

That said, it’s a bit of a hard line to draw. Sometimes stylists clip it too tightly or too loosely (only designers really know how it’s supposed to fit and they aren’t usually involved in the photoshoot process) and the result can be misleading. 

------------------


**Every Influencer Post Is An Advertisement**

If an influencer tags a brand in their photo or in their caption, they most likely were paid to do so (either via cash or via free clothing). I know this isn’t necessarily ground-breaking news, but I want to explain the depth of the system.

Most brands have influencers on rotation. One of my previous companies had 150+ each month who they would send X articles of clothing and/or cash (depends on the influencer’s follower count and country) in return for Y number of posts or Stories (sometimes we would write the caption for them). We would track engagement and clothing sales spikes to see if it was worth it to keep them on. On our roster, we purposefully would have anyone from large scale celebrities down to micro-influencers (girls with less than 2k followers but had high engagement who had potential to grow - think popular university students) and everyone in between. Only influencers who were just starting out would post for us without us giving them anything for free because they wanted to align to our brand. Over 10k followers, never. 

So yes, it is great that Instagram rolled out the “Paid Partnership” feature that makes it easier to tell what is an ad or what isn’t. But it’s actually in both the brand and the influencer’s interest to avoid the Paid Partnership feature. Brands want the posts to seem organic (it’s not cool to have to pay to be featured) and influencers do not want their feed to be solely advertisements (it’s not cool to be a sell out).

So yes, it is great that Instagram rolled out the “Paid Partnership” feature that makes it easier to tell what is an ad or what isn’t. But it’s actually in both the brand and the influencer’s interest to avoid the Paid Partnership feature. Brands want the posts to seem organic (it’s not cool to have to pay to be featured) and influencers do not want their feed to be solely advertisements (it’s not cool to be a sell out). Influencers will mainly choose to do Paid Partnerships if the company isn’t good for their image or if the company has a lot of cash to spare.

This, I suspect, is why Instagram is getting rid of public like figures. If you do a Paid Partnership post, the influencer grants the brand access to the data metrics (how many likes, how many people saw it, etc;) which they desperately need to track in order to determine ROI. Furthermore, Paid Partnership posts also allow brands to put money behind the post and boost it as an ad that appears organic. It’s effectively another cash grab from IG.  But both brands and influencers will continue to skirt these regardless.

**Everyone Copies Everyone… and Korea**

Brands I worked for used [WGSN](https://www.wgsn.com/en/) for trend forecasting from runways and I know majority of others do as well. They basically collate all of high fashion’s runways into a few distilled core trends per season. This is why sometimes you’ll see campaigns that are very similar from a number of brands at the same time. 

Competitor analysis is very, very real. Brands scrape competitor websites to figure out their inventory and determine if they have any gaps themselves. It is not uncommon to just straight up buy another brand’s garment and copy the pattern with slight adjustments.

This is particularly true when it comes to Dongdaemun, Seoul’s largest wholesale market. Lots of brands will either use patterns based off their inventory. Many others will actually just mark up, white label, and resell Korean wholesale market clothing. This is the case for Pixie Market (with the exception of their Made by Pixie Market section). Oh and those cheap accessories you see on fast fashion brands? Almost all of them are from Guangzhou in China.

--------------


**Greenwashing is Real**

If a fast fashion company is coming out with a CSR line, it’s not because they care about the environment. It’s because their PR department told them it was a great idea to combat any claims of them not being eco-friendly. And it’s because their merchandisers told them it was a great idea to jump on consumer trends.

That’s not to say CSR collections are bad. By buying them, you are encouraging the brand to continue to develop them. But unless environmental sustainability and fair labour are embedded within the brand’s DNA from its onset, it is most likely just a marketing ploy. The same can be said for inclusivity campaigns and banning retouching (you mean we can lay off our retouch team AND look woke? win fucking win).  

It’s worth noting that majority of brands share Asia factories with one another and conditions vary. China’s factory conditions have actually improved significantly over the years, so as a result, a lot of companies are migrated to places like Cambodia where conditions are more lenient and labor is cheaper - so be mindful of those labels. 

For what it's worth, I met a guy who works for an IGO in their fair labor division where his job was to raid clothing factories for inspection. He told me that Inditex was one of the better ones but that H&M and Uniqlo had by far the worst.

**Catalog Images Always Use Clips**

Last year, [ASOS faced some heat](https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/25/asos-slammed-after-being-caught-out-using-clips-on-models-dress-9318265/) when they accidentally uploaded a catalog image that showed the garment being clipped on the model. This practice is the standard across eCommerce catalog shooting. The actual reason isn’t to mislead the customer (although that is unfortunately the outcome) but it’s due to the nature of the eCommerce new arrival cycle.

Typically, company HQ only receives 1 or maybe 2 samples of every item that they can use to photograph for catalog and campaign images. These samples arrive much earlier than bulk stock in order to be photographed ahead of release, and when bulk stock is finally ready, it goes straight to warehouses or retail stores in order to save on shipping costs. Brands tend to rotate through different models who have different heights, weights, and sizes - which means they’re often too small for the sample size. Without clips, the garment will usually look too baggy or loose and will not reflect the true fitting of the item so stylists clip the item on the body then photoshop them out during retouching.

That said, it’s a bit of a hard line to draw. Sometimes stylists clip it too tightly or too loosely (only designers really know how it’s supposed to fit and they aren’t usually involved in the photoshoot process) and the result can be misleading.

**Every Influencer Post Is An Advertisement**

If an influencer tags a brand in their photo or in their caption, they most likely were paid to do so (either via cash or via free clothing). I know this isn’t necessarily ground-breaking news, but I want to explain the depth of the system.

Most brands have influencers on rotation. One of my previous companies had 150+ each month who they would send X articles of clothing and/or cash (depends on the influencer’s follower count and country) in return for Y number of posts or Stories (sometimes we would write the caption for them). We would track engagement and clothing sales spikes to see if it was worth it to keep them on. On our roster, we purposefully would have anyone from large scale celebrities down to micro-influencers (girls with less than 2k followers but had high engagement who had potential to grow - think popular university students) and everyone in between.

fourthwavewomen,FOOD FOR THOUGHT,How Shein and “Fast Fashion” Hurts Women,"So, today I checked out Shein for the first time. A lot of friends were buying from there, and I had to see what the hype was. I instead, discovered an incredibly exploitive, offensive, and cruel company that I want to discuss with you all.

Shein is a “fast fashion” company, which essentially means that they produce poor quality clothes and other products for extremely cheap. (Seriously…$4 for a dress? $1 for a graphic tee?). The thing about fast fashion, is that it relies on EXPLOITING very vulnerable populations, such as women and children. In fact, 80% of garment workers are women. One can find a $5 pair of jeans, and not even realize that the reason the jeans are only $5 is because of the long hours, low wages, and the dangerous labor conditions many women working in this industry are exposed to. The average female garment worker works 16 hours  and only takes home $2 per day. There are many cases where female garment workers and children died at work due to the unsafe conditions. A major example of this is when the Rana Plaza clothing factory in Bangladesh collapsed, and killed over 1,000 workers, many of whom were women.

Fast fashion companies like Shein don’t just harm the workers. It harms the buyers too! They feed on womens’ insecurities and bodies and idealises the fantasies instilled by the patriarchal society into their minds. Fast fashion creates an unsafe space for women and forces them into a cycle of insecurities, body image issues, creates a drive for consumption of trendy clothes to fit into the narrative created for them by the society, and accelerates self-esteem related mental health issues. It promotes a very narrow and unreasonable ideal body type, which teaches young girls and women that they are not enough unless they dress and behave exactly the way they are expected to. The target audience for Shein and similar companies is women ages 18-24. With this in mind, they sell many products tailored towards society’s beauty standards. The sites are riddled with hyper-sexualized clothes. The sites often go as far as to attract buyers to the sexualized and revealing outfits through use of models with photoshopped porn-star bodies. With social media amplifying age-old pressures for teenage girls to conform to certain sexualized narratives, many women feel pressured into purchasing these clothes to “fit in”. 

Overall, Shein is incredibly harmful to women in every aspect. To combat this, some women are deciding to support local businesses as well as ETHICAL clothing brands that actually empower women. Some women are also holding brands accountable for the way they treat their female employees and refuse to buy products from them if they choose to continue the exploitation, miserable long hours, and scanty pay.

My question for you all is, how do you feel about this? What were your experiences on fast fashion websites like? How else do these companies harm women? I’d love to participate in some dialogue about this lesser known issue!

EDIT: thank you all for the wonderful dialogue about the ethics of fast fashion. I want to address one topic that has repeatedly come up- the fact that many plus size women shop on Shein and other sites like it because it’s their only option to get cute, body inclusive, and comfortable clothes for an affordable price. I COMPLETELY understand this. My post was meant to educate people about the lesser known topic of anti-female fashion. It was NOT meant to tell you what you should or shouldn’t purchase. ALL women are impacted by patriarchal beauty standards, no matter their body type. In fact, the biggest point I was trying to drive home is that companies like Shein work to promote unreasonable ideal body types. This hurts all women, including plus size women. With that being said, In fashion, it’s a constant difficult choice between sacrificing affordability for ethics and ethics for affordability. Ultimately, it’s your body, so you should clothe yourself however works best for you and your confidence. I just wanted everyone to be aware that this problem exists. 

Lastly, I just want to stress the important of supporting businesses with size inclusivity. Size inclusive businesses promote body positivity and self love. By creating clothing that fits all body types, size inclusive businesses encourage people to embrace their bodies and feel confident in their own skin. This is a significant step towards dismantling unrealistic beauty standards that have long been perpetuated by the fashion industry. The beauty standards are the real devil of the fashion industry ",2023,"Totally agree with everything you said. I’d also add that by and large the clothes are cheap synthetic fibers that pollute the earth and end up in landfills very quickly due to the low quality of the material and craftsmanship. Fast fashion, Shein in particular, is an absolute menace. I cannot believe people waste their money on that garbage— I see it in thrift stores all the time and it is absolute trash. What a terrible waste of those workers’s time and lives."
fourthwavewomen,FOOD FOR THOUGHT,How Shein and “Fast Fashion” Hurts Women,"So, today I checked out Shein for the first time. A lot of friends were buying from there, and I had to see what the hype was. I instead, discovered an incredibly exploitive, offensive, and cruel company that I want to discuss with you all.

Shein is a “fast fashion” company, which essentially means that they produce poor quality clothes and other products for extremely cheap. (Seriously…$4 for a dress? $1 for a graphic tee?). The thing about fast fashion, is that it relies on EXPLOITING very vulnerable populations, such as women and children. In fact, 80% of garment workers are women. One can find a $5 pair of jeans, and not even realize that the reason the jeans are only $5 is because of the long hours, low wages, and the dangerous labor conditions many women working in this industry are exposed to. The average female garment worker works 16 hours  and only takes home $2 per day. There are many cases where female garment workers and children died at work due to the unsafe conditions. A major example of this is when the Rana Plaza clothing factory in Bangladesh collapsed, and killed over 1,000 workers, many of whom were women.

Fast fashion companies like Shein don’t just harm the workers. It harms the buyers too! They feed on womens’ insecurities and bodies and idealises the fantasies instilled by the patriarchal society into their minds. Fast fashion creates an unsafe space for women and forces them into a cycle of insecurities, body image issues, creates a drive for consumption of trendy clothes to fit into the narrative created for them by the society, and accelerates self-esteem related mental health issues. It promotes a very narrow and unreasonable ideal body type, which teaches young girls and women that they are not enough unless they dress and behave exactly the way they are expected to. The target audience for Shein and similar companies is women ages 18-24. With this in mind, they sell many products tailored towards society’s beauty standards. The sites are riddled with hyper-sexualized clothes. The sites often go as far as to attract buyers to the sexualized and revealing outfits through use of models with photoshopped porn-star bodies. With social media amplifying age-old pressures for teenage girls to conform to certain sexualized narratives, many women feel pressured into purchasing these clothes to “fit in”. 

Overall, Shein is incredibly harmful to women in every aspect. To combat this, some women are deciding to support local businesses as well as ETHICAL clothing brands that actually empower women. Some women are also holding brands accountable for the way they treat their female employees and refuse to buy products from them if they choose to continue the exploitation, miserable long hours, and scanty pay.

Many people think as long as they don't buy from the obvious places like Shein, wish, Teemu, aliexpress and so on, they are doing good.

But the common chains you know and bought from, are probably producing their clothes in sweatshops. Expensive designer clothes are made in sweat shops too. Even some ""ethical"" clothing is immensely greenwashed and from sweat shops. Therefore, I think it is incredibly hard to avoid supporting this practice, especially if you don't have much money.

While there are some companies that at least reduce the amount of harm they do to vulnerable women, children and nature, their downside is often that they aren't affordable for many people. This means that often enough, it is the ""better"" option for poor people to buy fast fashion, because it will give you more options. 100 USD in fast fashion is a whole variety of clothes even if their quality is shit, whereas for many ethical labels, it's maybe 2-3 pieces.

If a woman, especially in a professional setting, is wearing the exact same outfit everyday, I am pretty sure that sooner or later, co-workers will catch onto that and it will 100% mark her as a weirdo. (Same thing might happen to a man too, but I am pretty sure a man will get away with that for longer because men's fashion is boring and there isn't as much importance on how a man looks vs. how a woman looks.)"

The beauty standards are the real devil of the fashion industry ",2023,"majority of men i meet that are making a fortune in the 'fashion industry' are men working in fast fashion e-commerce. funny how they all make/sell clothes to women and not men, when they themselves are men.

they know the endless consumerism and chasing beauty standard and fashion trends for women is where most of the money is made. it's made of off making women feel like they're never enough. they'll never be pretty enough. never be chic enough. never have enough clothes.

it's infuriating the way women make less money than men on average, yet we are expected to spend so much money on maintaining our appearance, because our appearance is everything. it's how much we are valued in society.

so much pressure to be fashionable and trendy and compete with other women. trend cycles are so fast they last maybe 2 weeks before the next microtrend on the internet and you have to get it first to show all your followers!

women get judged harshly for repeating outfits yet men can wear the same thing for a whole week and no one says anything!

there's a whole meme called ""over-dressed gf and under-dressed bf"" joking how the gf puts lot of effort into her outfit and the man doesn't try at all. also reminds me of the recent [pics](https://images.app.goo.gl/kzYCGnbvWFdXuiMR9)of justin and hailey bieber going to haileys krispy kreme launch event. no shade to justin but it's goes to show where we are at socially to joke how normalized this is.


getting dressed is just one in many ways that women try so hard and men don't try or use weaponized incompetence (emotional labor in a relationship, housework/chores, childcare, managing family events, etc )"

ALL women are impacted by patriarchal beauty standards, no matter their body type. In fact, the biggest point I was trying to drive home is that companies like Shein work to promote unreasonable ideal body types. This hurts all women, including plus size women. With that being said, In fashion, it’s a constant difficult choice between sacrificing affordability for ethics and ethics for affordability. Ultimately, it’s your body, so you should clothe yourself however works best for you and your confidence. I just wanted everyone to be aware that this problem exists. 

Lastly, I just want to stress the important of supporting businesses with size inclusivity. Size inclusive businesses promote body positivity and self love. By creating clothing that fits all body types, size inclusive businesses encourage people to embrace their bodies and feel confident in their own skin. This is a significant step towards dismantling unrealistic beauty standards that have long been perpetuated by the fashion industry. The beauty standards are the real devil of the fashion industry ",2023,"Fast fashion not only hurts women and children, but it's terrible for the environment. The whole idea of fast fashion is to buy, wear, and discard, and it works because the items are such low quality and need to be replaced rapidly, creating more than can be donated landing the items in landfills. Most manufacturers are in countries where human rights and environmental laws allow for exploitation."
fourthwavewomen,FOOD FOR THOUGHT,How Shein and “Fast Fashion” Hurts Women,"So, today I checked out Shein for the first time. A lot of friends were buying from there, and I had to see what the hype was. I instead, discovered an incredibly exploitive, offensive, and cruel company that I want to discuss with you all.

Shein is a “fast fashion” company, which essentially means that they produce poor quality clothes and other products for extremely cheap. (Seriously…$4 for a dress? $1 for a graphic tee?). The thing about fast fashion, is that it relies on EXPLOITING very vulnerable populations, such as women and children. In fact, 80% of garment workers are women. One can find a $5 pair of jeans, and not even realize that the reason the jeans are only $5 is because of the long hours, low wages, and the dangerous labor conditions many women working in this industry are exposed to. The average female garment worker works 16 hours  and only takes home $2 per day. There are many cases where female garment workers and children died at work due to the unsafe conditions. A major example of this is when the Rana Plaza clothing factory in Bangladesh collapsed, and killed over 1,000 workers, many of whom were women.

Fast fashion companies like Shein don’t just harm the workers. It harms the buyers too! They feed on womens’ insecurities and bodies and idealises the fantasies instilled by the patriarchal society into their minds. Fast fashion creates an unsafe space for women and forces them into a cycle of insecurities, body image issues, creates a drive for consumption of trendy clothes to fit into the narrative created for them by the society, and accelerates self-esteem related mental health issues. It promotes a very narrow and unreasonable ideal body type, which teaches young girls and women that they are not enough unless they dress and behave exactly the way they are expected to. The target audience for Shein and similar companies is women ages 18-24. With this in mind, they sell many products tailored towards society’s beauty standards. The sites are riddled with hyper-sexualized clothes. The sites often go as far as to attract buyers to the sexualized and revealing outfits through use of models with photoshopped porn-star bodies. With social media amplifying age-old pressures for teenage girls to conform to certain sexualized narratives, many women feel pressured into purchasing these clothes to “fit in”. 

Overall, Shein is incredibly harmful to women in every aspect. To combat this, some women are deciding to support local businesses as well as ETHICAL clothing brands that actually empower women. Some women are also holding brands accountable for the way they treat their female employees and refuse to buy products from them if they choose to continue the exploitation, miserable long hours, and scanty pay.

Buying from shein cuts out the rich American middle man. It’s putting dollars directly in the hands of the people who would have supplied us the clothing anyway. If we want a moral alternative, it must be American made clothing. 

The children’s place uses Bangladeshi sweat shops for clothes, one time an entire multi floor building collapsed and killed a bunch of women working there and they are still doing great, they are in every mall still to this day. Those women also sell their hair for wigs and live in the same conditions that Chinese workers do (maybe worse, honestly). We just hear about shein because we are deluding ourselves into thinking American clothing exists, and moral clothing exists by buying it through a “reputable” middle man, supporting a whole industry of resellers here, which is the last shred of our once thriving textile industry that fueled the middle class. 

If your politicians cared, they would impose heavy taxes on imported clothing, but they can’t because that’s all there is and they are in the pockets of people who profit off of that. Literally zero companies are moving manufacturing back to America."

I'd argue most people who order from Shein and fast fashion are aware to some degree of many of these issues; they just don't care. 

They have a desired aesthetic, and they will stop at nothing to achieve that desired aesthetic. Women really are our own voyeurs; we love thinking about how great we will look in an article of clothing. We love thinking about the pictures or videos we're going to take when we are in that outfit, what the background will be, how we will pose, what platform we will upload it to, how many people will see us in it, and we cannot wait for other people (especially men!) to see us in that outfit. Half of the fun of going somewhere, of traveling internationally or going somewhere local, is thinking about what we will wear when we are there and how the picture or tiktok or whatever will turn out.

The desire to wear something great and for others to see us in it runs deep, and I don't think we will be able to move beyond fast fashion until we move beyond seeing ourselves as ornaments to display."

In other words, LITERALLY every single thing on your phone, they can and will access. The reason why other websites who collect data don’t go this far is because Temu uses malicious code that allows them to bypass security settings on your phone, read all of your messages and notifications, and change your settings. According to ACTUAL Temu employees who spoke to CNN, the company goes to such lengths in order to “spy on users and competitors in order to boost sales” and that selling the data they collect “is Temu’s largest  source of revenue”. In fact, Temu’s revenue from 2022 consisted of only 11% merchandise sales and a whopping 63% data sales. They’re making a MASSIVE profit off of your data, and barely any profit from sales.

This leads many to believe that Temu only uses it’s cheap prices to lure people in. The real money maker is the data your device brings with you…..ominous…."
fourthwavewomen,FOOD FOR THOUGHT,How Shein and “Fast Fashion” Hurts Women,"So, today I checked out Shein for the first time. A lot of friends were buying from there, and I had to see what the hype was. I instead, discovered an incredibly exploitive, offensive, and cruel company that I want to discuss with you all.

Shein is a “fast fashion” company, which essentially means that they produce poor quality clothes and other products for extremely cheap. (Seriously…$4 for a dress? $1 for a graphic tee?). The thing about fast fashion, is that it relies on EXPLOITING very vulnerable populations, such as women and children. In fact, 80% of garment workers are women. One can find a $5 pair of jeans, and not even realize that the reason the jeans are only $5 is because of the long hours, low wages, and the dangerous labor conditions many women working in this industry are exposed to. The average female garment worker works 16 hours  and only takes home $2 per day. There are many cases where female garment workers and children died at work due to the unsafe conditions. A major example of this is when the Rana Plaza clothing factory in Bangladesh collapsed, and killed over 1,000 workers, many of whom were women.

Fast fashion companies like Shein don’t just harm the workers. It harms the buyers too! They feed on womens’ insecurities and bodies and idealises the fantasies instilled by the patriarchal society into their minds. Fast fashion creates an unsafe space for women and forces them into a cycle of insecurities, body image issues, creates a drive for consumption of trendy clothes to fit into the narrative created for them by the society, and accelerates self-esteem related mental health issues. It promotes a very narrow and unreasonable ideal body type, which teaches young girls and women that they are not enough unless they dress and behave exactly the way they are expected to. The target audience for Shein and similar companies is women ages 18-24. With this in mind, they sell many products tailored towards society’s beauty standards. The sites are riddled with hyper-sexualized clothes. The sites often go as far as to attract buyers to the sexualized and revealing outfits through use of models with photoshopped porn-star bodies. With social media amplifying age-old pressures for teenage girls to conform to certain sexualized narratives, many women feel pressured into purchasing these clothes to “fit in”. 

Overall, Shein is incredibly harmful to women in every aspect. To combat this, some women are deciding to support local businesses as well as ETHICAL clothing brands that actually empower women. Some women are also holding brands accountable for the way they treat their female employees and refuse to buy products from them if they choose to continue the exploitation, miserable long hours, and scanty pay.

My question for you all is, how do you feel about this? What were your experiences on fast fashion websites like? How else do these companies harm women? I’d love to participate in some dialogue about this lesser known issue!

EDIT: thank you all for the wonderful dialogue about the ethics of fast fashion. I want to address one topic that has repeatedly come up- the fact that many plus size women shop on Shein and other sites like it because it’s their only option to get cute, body inclusive, and comfortable clothes for an affordable price. I COMPLETELY understand this. My post was meant to educate people about the lesser known topic of anti-female fashion. It was NOT meant to tell you what you should or shouldn’t purchase. ALL women are impacted by patriarchal beauty standards, no matter their body type. In fact, the biggest point I was trying to drive home is that companies like Shein work to promote unreasonable ideal body types. This hurts all women, including plus size women. With that being said, In fashion, it’s a constant difficult choice between sacrificing affordability for ethics and ethics for affordability. Ultimately, it’s your body, so you should clothe yourself however works best for you and your confidence. I just wanted everyone to be aware that this problem exists. 

Lastly, I just want to stress the important of supporting businesses with size inclusivity. Size inclusive businesses promote body positivity and self love. By creating clothing that fits all body types, size inclusive businesses encourage people to embrace their bodies and feel confident in their own skin. This is a significant step towards dismantling unrealistic beauty standards that have long been perpetuated by the fashion industry. The beauty standards are the real devil of the fashion industry ",2023,"I'm in the upper limits of most cute plus size stuff. I don't shop at Shein, but the prices are alluring. Most clothing in my size, regardless of style or fabric,  is incredibly expensive. Even Walmart has started to carry less plus sized clothing in stores. For those on the fatter end of even the plus size spectrum Shein offers what we can't find elsewhere: something to cover our bodies.

Like yes, I can buy more intentionally or wait for sales,  but in the meantime I'm rapidly running out of underwear and pants. Thrift stores aren't really carrying things in my size that are appropriate for daily wear,  if at all. 

Fashion in general hurts women."

all fast fashion hurts women. even if you're buying a 20 dollar tshirt from pull and bear or a pair of nike shoes you're still supporting exploitation but with a 200% profit margin. this conversation about shein is important, specially considering how much they polute, but the whole fashion industry is set up that way, not just the brands with 1$ shirts."

The thing about fast fashion, is that it relies on EXPLOITING very vulnerable populations, such as women and children. In fact, 80% of garment workers are women. One can find a $5 pair of jeans, and not even realize that the reason the jeans are only $5 is because of the long hours, low wages, and the dangerous labor conditions many women working in this industry are exposed to. The average female garment worker works 16 hours  and only takes home $2 per day. There are many cases where female garment workers and children died at work due to the unsafe conditions. A major example of this is when the Rana Plaza clothing factory in Bangladesh collapsed, and killed over 1,000 workers, many of whom were women.

Fast fashion companies like Shein don’t just harm the workers. It harms the buyers too! They feed on womens’ insecurities and bodies and idealises the fantasies instilled by the patriarchal society into their minds. Fast fashion creates an unsafe space for women and forces them into a cycle of insecurities, body image issues, creates a drive for consumption of trendy clothes to fit into the narrative created for them by the society, and accelerates self-esteem related mental health issues. It promotes a very narrow and unreasonable ideal body type, which teaches young girls and women that they are not enough unless they dress and behave exactly the way they are expected to. The target audience for Shein and similar companies is women ages 18-24. With this in mind, they sell many products tailored towards society’s beauty standards. The sites are riddled with hyper-sexualized clothes. The sites often go as far as to attract buyers to the sexualized and revealing outfits through use of models with photoshopped porn-star bodies. With social media amplifying age-old pressures for teenage girls to conform to certain sexualized narratives, many women feel pressured into purchasing these clothes to “fit in”. 

Overall, Shein is incredibly harmful to women in every aspect. To combat this, some women are deciding to support local businesses as well as ETHICAL clothing brands that actually empower women. Some women are also holding brands accountable for the way they treat their female employees and refuse to buy products from them if they choose to continue the exploitation, miserable long hours, and scanty pay.

My question for you all is, how do you feel about this? What were your experiences on fast fashion websites like? How else do these companies harm women? I’d love to participate in some dialogue about this lesser known issue!

EDIT: thank you all for the wonderful dialogue about the ethics of fast fashion. I want to address one topic that has repeatedly come up- the fact that many plus size women shop on Shein and other sites like it because it’s their only option to get cute, body inclusive, and comfortable clothes for an affordable price. I COMPLETELY understand this. My post was meant to educate people about the lesser known topic of anti-female fashion. It was NOT meant to tell you what you should or shouldn’t purchase. ALL women are impacted by patriarchal beauty standards, no matter their body type. In fact, the biggest point I was trying to drive home is that companies like Shein work to promote unreasonable ideal body types. This hurts all women, including plus size women. With that being said, In fashion, it’s a constant difficult choice between sacrificing affordability for ethics and ethics for affordability. Ultimately, it’s your body, so you should clothe yourself however works best for you and your confidence. I just wanted everyone to be aware that this problem exists. 

Lastly, I just want to stress the important of supporting businesses with size inclusivity. Size inclusive businesses promote body positivity and self love. By creating clothing that fits all body types, size inclusive businesses encourage people to embrace their bodies and feel confident in their own skin. This is a significant step towards dismantling unrealistic beauty standards that have long been perpetuated by the fashion industry. The beauty standards are the real devil of the fashion industry ",2023,The standards for workers are worse for stores you buy in malls. Workers don’t get paid any more. SHEIN also helps the environment and upcoming designers and is body inclusive. And it’s not fast fashion if you keep wearing the clothes for years.

Brands like Sézane, Arket, & Other Stories, use a lot of high quality materials in their clothes (wool, merino, cashmere, cotton, silk etc) so they last longer and feel more luxurious. But they're not really produced ethically (Arket and & Other Stories for example are part of the H&M group) so that's why I like to buy them second hand. Bonus is that if you do get bored with an item after a while, you can easily resell them on Vinted again, because the quality remains good. 

Do note that some of their clothes are still made from bad materials like polyester, so it's always worth it to check the material with the seller before you buy. 

Vinted also has an option to filter on material these days. So if you're looking for a cashmere jumper for example, you can easily sort on that. Good way to get high quality items for a lower price."

malefashionadvice,Video,The Ugly Truth Of Fast Fashion,,2019,"Just watched this the other night. I gotta say it's incredible how many clothes people buy and I think his point about social media influencing the need to buy new clothing is very on point. 

That said, I think a lot of the style that MFA tends to advocate for (in the most general sense) is stuff that is fairly timeless and nondescript but looks good when layered and combined with other pieces. This is the whole principle of the ""Basic Bastard"" look that is so popular. It's a clothing style that will last you years, and you won't feel any need to throw something out because it's not trendy enough, for example.

Fashion can have different meanings. In this video, they use fashion to describe popular trends over a short period of time and the manufacturing cycles for these clothing trends that produce a ton of waste. In the case of this subreddit, I'd say it usually means more like how to look generally good and presentable.

Also thought it was great that he calls out these companies on their ""environmentally sustainable"" bullshit."

malefashionadvice,Video,The Ugly Truth Of Fast Fashion,,2019,"Lady here. Just watched the ep and I'm torn. Coming from an immigrant family, you wear your shirts/pants until they've been sewn over 10 times and then as a once broke college student working 3 jobs, I had to shop at places like Forever 21 and H&M. I couldn't even afford Zara...

Though rare, there are high-quality items in these stores. I have a suit jacket from H&M that has been a lucky charm at job interviews since my college days (almost 10 years ago) and faux leather boots from Forever 21 that I got 5 years ago that are still waterproof (seasonally worn). 

But I don't agree with how these fast fashion companies are churning out styles and being wasteful. IMO the blame doesn't fall entirely on the companies though. I would argue that the blame is more on wasteful consumers, as it's in the culture to just throw things away, at least in the U.S. 

Nowadays, I buy ~10 pieces/year from inexpensive to pricey brands. How on earth are people are buying 80 pieces/year?! My parents keep only 5 articles of each type of apparel (5 work shirts, 5 regular tops, 5 skirts, 5 dresses, 5 pants, etc.), and they wear them until they are shredded.

Maybe if this kind of mentality was more prevalent, there would be less of an environmental problem from fashion! Also, check out Poshmark. There are some great unloved items on there, and it helps keep my closet the same size. Sell 1 thing, buy 1 thing. Rinse, repeat."

malefashionadvice,Video,The Ugly Truth Of Fast Fashion,,2019,"Until recently (post bankruptcy declaration) I worked at Forever 21. I recently posted this story on /r/frugalmalefashion .  It is relivent here. 



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I have been hanging out (and especially buying) less and less from this subreddit. My reasons are a bit more unique.

Until recently, I worked at Forever 21 corporate. Coincidentally, as I started to work there, I became more concerned and aware of fast fashion's impact on the environment. I also saw it around me with the amount of cardboard, plastic and cheap clothing that was thrown out and roaming in the hallways every day. There wasn't a day that went by I didn't pick up a blouse, cardboard, plastic or tags from all over the place. It is so wasteful.

One weekend, we had a Warehouse sale. They converted the parking lot into a giant clothing graveyard that was littered with clothes, cardboard, and plastic. I did not attend the event however, the horror hit me Monday morning.

I got to work and walked through the parking lot and was shook by the scene in front of me. There was trash EVERYWHERE! the ground, the trees, stuck to the fence. People went through and decimated the boxes and contents. Clothes that were trampled in the rush. Left grimy on the floor covered in footprints and tangled in bits of plastic. These trash piles were taller than me. The wind was depositing the filth on the already filthy downtown Los Angeles streets as the cleanup crew showed little regard for the loose garbage as it flew away.

I left that job and decided to break the personal cycle. I went through my closet and removed items that did not fit or I did not wear. Many of these items were FMF pickups. Things that everyone else was clamoring over so I scooped them up before they sold out. Shirts that never fit, did not go with anything else I owned or things I regrettably bought on impulse, did not work and was too lazy to return. These items were donated to charity (except for my beat-up Killshots, those had to go to the trash).

I am fortunate enough to have lost enough weight to go down two sizes in my shirt this year (XL to Medium). As I was at Target with my basket full of the shirts I ""liked"" in half a dozen colors, I paused and thought to myself ""I can do better"". I left the shirts behind and came home in search of better. I learned what colors work for me and how to use them. I also learned about fit and what truly looks good on me. I went in person to check out a made in the USA boutique. The shirts were double what I would normally pay ($15-$32) yet they fit me like a dream, are made of much better materials and I had a salesperson to support me with color choices, fit and styling ideas.

I do not need 15-20 shirts. I now have 6 solid colors that I use to build on. They are more comfortable, better fitting, more distinctive colors and I am way more confident in them. I took an afternoon, did research, asked questions and now my fashion game has stepped up so much. I now see the value in buying one great fitting pair of jeans as opposed to three randos I got at a Uniqlo sale. Do your homework, it will pay off for you and the planet.

If you need to hear it today, you do not need those items from Gap, JCrew, Uniqlo or Xmas timbs. Trust me. I almost got the astronaut slippers too. You can resist and do better."

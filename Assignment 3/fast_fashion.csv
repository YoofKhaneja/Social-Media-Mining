Awesome video, it's all about fast fashion and its detriment to the environment. Also, climate town is amazing if you haven't watched.

Edit: Added title of video"
Anticonsumption,Society/Culture,Fast fashion trending,,2022,"840 dollars is enough to buy actual quality  clothing that will last for years to come, I don’t understand what these influencers are trying to prove here. This is so wasteful"

Then some dickhead invented disposable vapes.

Anticonsumption,Society/Culture,Fast fashion trending,,2022,"I get that a lot of people grew up consuming things. This is all they effectively know and they think it's really cool.

But the thing is they don't realize how badly they're hurting people. They don't realize it because it's not like they have it in bold letters saying ""HEY WE USED OUR SLAVES TO MAKE THESE CLOTHES FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU JUST HAD TO WEAR THESE""

They don't even have anything close to that and to be honest it would tank their numbers. But would that be all bad?"
Anticonsumption,Society/Culture,Fast fashion trending,,2022,"I actually don't understand how can grown up adults just... not care? Because we are literally bombarded with problems regarding climate change, all these documentaries, actions, advice to be more sustainable, etc. How the fuck are you so obsessed with making content and posting a new outfit every day that you don't even think for a split second about the consequences of the things you choose to do"
Anticonsumption,Society/Culture,Fast fashion trending,,2022,I feel like criticizing these girls is low hanging fruit and missing the source of the problem. There’s so much money to be made from instilling deep rooted insecurities into little girls then selling them false solutions as they get older. These girls aren’t the problem.

You'll never have a cool story behind an article of clothing you found on an app. You also get out of the house and shop *more* since that's where most of the enjoyment comes from.

femalefashionadvice,,Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?,"Over the last year, I’ve gotten much more interested in sustainable & ethical clothing and have immersed myself in researching these topics. 

Questions like: is _____ ethical? Is _____ sustainable? Where can I buy affordable but ethical clothing? Plague my google search history. 

As a 24 year old who is finally making a decent salary but has been primarily a fast fashion consumer up until a year or so ago, I want to do and be better. 

But a point I’ve seen made many times while reading countless articles about clothing manufacturing ethics and sustainability is that by definition, fast fashion is bad because it’s not made to last and is made for mass consumption. Trendy pieces and cheaply made pieces made to last maybe a season or two. 

So where does that leave the consumer who has a closet full of items purchased at fast fashion retailers, but rarely makes new purchases and many of their current pieces have remained in their closet for years? 

Obviously the issue is layered and nuanced. Sure maybe I have a fast fashion t shirt that cost me $3 that I’ve gotten three years of wear out of, but obviously a $3 shirt wasn’t made sustainably or ethically. But is there a point where the trade off of ethics and sustainability becomes worth it? 

Is the “fast fashion” buyer who makes new purchases maybe a few times a year and keeps that clothing for years better or worse than the “mid range” clothing buyer who buys clothing monthly (or maybe even more?) and gets fewer uses out of each article of clothing? 

This topic bothers me because I feel like there’s no good choice unless you have $$$ to spend on the few brands that are sustainable and ethical. Is Aritzia or J Crew that much better than Forever 21 or Fashion Nova? Is the clothing quality that much better that it warrants a 300%+ price increase? Are their ethics/sustainability practices better?

Even luxury and designer brands have questionable histories, like Chanel. 

It’s just so frustrating! I feel like in the last year or two in particular there has been a sharp uptick in clothing “boutiques” and online only clothing stores which just muddy the waters further & make the shopping process that much more confusing for the average consumer. 

I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts on this matter! This has been bugging me for forever and no one IRL I know wants to have this conversation.

ETA: I just want to include that for the time being I’ve decided to predominantly buy secondhand and have been buying clothes through Vinted pretty much exclusively for the last year, until I can find other options I am comfortable with :)",2021,"The defining characteristic of fast fashion is its 2-12 week production cycle. It's not about how long you or any individual customer keeps any individual item.

It's also not about you in another sense. Fast fashion brands pump out up to 24 collections a year - that's a lot of clothes. [It's well-documented that this is an overproduction of clothing](https://sharecloth.com/blog/reports/apparel-overproduction), and even though the post-production circulation of this clothing [has its own deleterious effects](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-fashion-blog/2015/feb/13/second-hand-clothes-charity-donations-africa#comment-47509657), even if every customer kept their fast fashion purchases for 10 years, [the cost of this enormous production volume would remain](https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/december-2019-march-2020/battling-damaging-effects-%E2%80%98fast-fashion%E2%80%99). This is a systemic problem, and you can't solve it by keeping all your H&M t-shirts for 10 years.

And like, I get where this OP is coming from. I think there is a tendency, particularly on this sub, to blame the unsustainability of the fashion industry on individual consumers, which forces individual consumers to justify their fast fashion purchases as still sustainable in some sense. And of course blaming the individual for the crimes of fast fashion completely misses the point, and most of the solutions that people come up with (just make your own clothes!!111) are totally asinine. It's also kind of insidious how this personal responsibility rhetoric essentially protects corporations and governments from civil society coming together to push for system-level change - especially given that corporations in particular promote personal responsibility to sustainability (buying Eileen Fisher is basically just as impactful as pushing tighter environmental regulations!). I think this rhetoric pushes people to fight between themselves rather than banding together to push for meaningful change.

So I just also want to say that none of this is your fault. You're not a bad person if you can't afford to not buy fast fashion, and you don't owe anybody an excuse for surviving in the system you're in. But I think it's also important to draw a line between defending yourself from accusations of unsustainability and defending the industry from the same - and unfortunately, because of the way we've structured this rhetoric in the US and in this sub in particular, the two usually get blurred."

I try not to buy much and attempt to not buy from companies that seem particularly egregious, and I do thrift, but I’m also still paying off student loans and hardly raking in the cash.

Is it better to buy your one shirt every 3 years from a sustainable brand that treats its workers well? For sure! But I’m typing this my iPhone with a Macbook in front of me and to be honest, so are a lot of people that claim to only shop ethically. Do what you can, absolutely, but let’s not let perfect be the enemy of good."

I have some more expensive, sustainable items I’ve added in the last couple years but the majority of my closet still includes “fast fashion” basics that have lasted quite a while and I won’t be tossing anytime soon. Curious to hear more discussion here - from an environmental standpoint, I’d think it would be better to buy less overall regardless of manufacturer, and when you do *need* to buy something, seek out more sustainable or ethical brands or thrift?"

ETA: I just want to include that for the time being I’ve decided to predominantly buy secondhand and have been buying clothes through Vinted pretty much exclusively for the last year, until I can find other options I am comfortable with :)",2021,"Sustainability professional chiming in - I think this topic really hits on a theme in sustainability that is difficult and frustrating to understand: sustainability is full of trade offs. It makes selecting the “sustainable option” nuanced and compromising for individual consumers. While I think awareness of the impact of your choices is incredibly valuable and focusing on sustainability as a priority when exercising your purchase power makes a difference, I really resent the pressure being put on individuals to “make the right choice” when it comes at a cost (either literally or figuratively) in another scenario. 
Companies have spent decades funding the message that we, the individual consumers, are responsible for the impact consumerism has on the environment. While supply and demand obviously go hand in hand, the true goal for individual consumers should be focusing their voting power on demanding companies take responsibility of intersectional sustainability (ie you shouldn’t have to be privileged to purchase sustainable products). Change does come with purchase power, but right now there will always be a trade off. It’s up to voting for government officials and policies that give ownership of the problem as shared responsibility between consumers and companies (but primarily on companies). 
All in all, outside of voting, the best thing you can do is be conscious of what you’re purchasing and where it goes when you’re done with it. Align to priorities that map to yours (whether it’s low carbon impact, human rights, circular economics, water / land impact etc), and do the best you can in that area understanding there’s other consumers who prioritize other aspects of sustainability that are meaningful to them. Even if you can’t find the perfect solution, every conscious effort helps."

Plus, when I do shop it's only for the things I need, and I'll often go months without buying any new clothes.

Meanwhile there are plenty of wealthy people (or middle class people) buying top-name brands who throw out their wardrobe every year and replace the whole thing, or go shopping every weekend.

And ultimately a brand saying they're made more sustainably doesn't mean they're completely free of any exploitation or harm to the environment, either. It's unfair to put this huge burden on the consumer to live in a perfectly environmentally-friendly way when the vast majority of the *blame* for harm to the environment is on major corporations who are actually doing the mass producing. It's also unfair to hold up a standard of individual moral ""purity"" that the majority of people cannot afford. Ultimately, saving the environment is something that will only be accomplished with the cooperation of those with the power to make large-scale change, and currently those corporations put an undue amount of pressure on individual consumer decision-making instead of making those decisions themselves.

But I digress a bit - to answer your question, i think it's more about how you buy and consume things than about the label. If you limit what you buy to just what you need with a couple of indulgences here and there, and shop thrift stores or resold items instead of buying new all the time, you're being WAY more sustainable than someone who drops the cash on buying high-end ""green"" brands in amounts way more than they need."

As a 24 year old who is finally making a decent salary but has been primarily a fast fashion consumer up until a year or so ago, I want to do and be better. 

But a point I’ve seen made many times while reading countless articles about clothing manufacturing ethics and sustainability is that by definition, fast fashion is bad because it’s not made to last and is made for mass consumption. Trendy pieces and cheaply made pieces made to last maybe a season or two. 

So where does that leave the consumer who has a closet full of items purchased at fast fashion retailers, but rarely makes new purchases and many of their current pieces have remained in their closet for years? 

Obviously the issue is layered and nuanced. Sure maybe I have a fast fashion t shirt that cost me $3 that I’ve gotten three years of wear out of, but obviously a $3 shirt wasn’t made sustainably or ethically. But is there a point where the trade off of ethics and sustainability becomes worth it? 

Is the “fast fashion” buyer who makes new purchases maybe a few times a year and keeps that clothing for years better or worse than the “mid range” clothing buyer who buys clothing monthly (or maybe even more?) and gets fewer uses out of each article of clothing? 

This topic bothers me because I feel like there’s no good choice unless you have $$$ to spend on the few brands that are sustainable and ethical. Is Aritzia or J Crew that much better than Forever 21 or Fashion Nova? Is the clothing quality that much better that it warrants a 300%+ price increase? Are their ethics/sustainability practices better?

Even luxury and designer brands have questionable histories, like Chanel. 

It’s just so frustrating! I feel like in the last year or two in particular there has been a sharp uptick in clothing “boutiques” and online only clothing stores which just muddy the waters further & make the shopping process that much more confusing for the average consumer.

So has r/frugal I guess and there are a few other subs. I don't think there is a fixed rule. The world is changing too fast for that.

Maybe the key is to scale down spending, thrift as much as possible and be critical when shopping. Price does not necessarily equals quality.  

The way I see it, high-end brands are just expensive. Nowadays luxury brands seem to be as mass-produced as anything else. Profit above all.

I also have realized that brand loyalty in the 21st century might have become a bit silly. I have trusted brands in the past but it seems pointless now, bc even sizing can change randomly.

Maybe customers shd spend more carefully. Buy what is needed, make sure what you are getting is looking good on you, it looks well-made and it feels nice on your skin. It is better to have fewer garments that make you look superb than many trashy pieces that will not do you any justice. Every person has their beauty, we shd only have and wear what makes us look fabulous.

My two cents"

Also 24 with money and a recent interest in sustainable fashion. I originally got interested in the issue after watching some of Bernadette Banner's videos, I highly recommend if you haven't heard of her! She's a fashion historian with some really great video essays. 

In regards to your actual question, for me it comes down to labor practices. Yes, keeping fast fashion items in your closet longer than ""typical"" is good, but they were still made by severely underpaying workers who are often women and children. I've been trying to research companies that have ethical supply chains and put info about their factories and workforce online. It is very pricey I'll admit, but I feel good knowing someone was paid fairly for sewing it, since garment making is very hard work! It also makes me think harder about whether i need something for my closet or i just want it. 

It is a really complex and nuanced issue, and at the end of the day, there is no perfect company. Global supply chains and growing fibers for clothes both pollute. But we can try to support the best companies in the hopes of making a difference"

ETA: I just want to include that for the time being I’ve decided to predominantly buy secondhand and have been buying clothes through Vinted pretty much exclusively for the last year, until I can find other options I am comfortable with :)",2021,"I love your question so much, I came to my laptop so I can type a proper response.

Technically,  yes. You have consumed fast fashion. It was made quickly, likely exploitatively, and unsustainably. Someone was probably severely underpaid and/or worked in unsafe conditions. Environmental damage was likely done to produce the fabrics and dyes. There is likely also textile waste dumped in association with your garments' creations. Even if your consumption is slow, and you are trying to hold onto things, you've moved your consumption practices to a place that is sustainable and ethical, it's still on someone's back and likely harming the planet.

**HOWEVER!!!!**

I understand that sustainable fashion is expensive. Ethical and fair trade is a lot for most people. One garment is a car note, half a rent payment, 2 weeks of groceries. It's a huge mind shift after generations of textile and clothing prices plummeting. It also highlights our own experiences with inequality, expectations around grooming, consumption, and presentation. I remember being my early 20s and buying suits from H&M because it was expected to dress stylishly, professionally, and in a way that reflected the company. I couldn't always even afford that and frankly, it cost me opportunities, professional relationships, and more because of the perception of poverty and other negative associations including, but not limited to my race, gender, and social class.

I can't preach to anyone who is paying off student loan debt, trying to build a savings account, sending money home to family, or just trying to keep up well enough until hitting a point of something resembling financial security about buying a $10 USD or less shirt. I think these systems are connected and exploitative, but I don't think it's the fault of the individual consumer for being forced into the cycle. We can think bigger, be conscientious, and try to put our money and time in places that are moving towards a positive direction.

You're already taking these steps by caring for your things. I don't know if you mend, but it'll extend the life. Skip the dryer, it helps preserve the fabric. You are taking responsibility and reducing your footprint. Is it perfect, no. Is that okay... I think we can only do the best we can with the resources available to us.

Some people may come and talk about thrifting or sewing your own clothing. This too has a cost.

Thrifting makes that too expensive for people who have to thrift. So where's the balance? How can we as consumers make this space more equitable? How can companies? Can we hold them accountable? What's the impact when it's supporting small businesses -- young women who have time to search the shops and get the clothing that is less expensive than new to women who have means, but not enough for high end clothing? What conversations and considerations could we have to rethink consumption in the second hand market? Including how even that contributes to textile waste.

Sewing is NOT cheap. Yes, there are some influencers (usually young, thin, beautiful) who sew bedsheets and tablecloths (functional, but I'm not going to get into why that probably shouldn't a long term way to work). There's still a lot to learn, consider with fabric purchases (is this a polluting material? is this at an exploitative price? why is this cheap? where did it come from?). Some people get super cheap yardage, but it's worth looking into why is it cheap. By the yard, it can get expensive. Then there's the labor. I think about how much my dinky, simplistic, me-made garments would retail with labor and materials cost and it's not cheap if I calculate at a living wage independent of other business expenses.

It's complicated, but I'm super jazzed you're thinking about this. The large and small impacts and challenging what do these labels mean. What do our habits do in the long run? Why do we hold some designers in such high regard and what does affordable and sustainable mean? I ask that always when someone asks for something affordable. ""What is affordable to this person? Near free? $50? $100? Does this person's affordable exploit someone else? Does this person's affordable make the next life decision simpler for them and they can go on another day?"""

I try to donate, upcycle, or trade any clothes I get rid of instead of just throwing them out to try to offset any damage done by the item's production, but it really is difficult to totally rebrand your closet. Also, I tend to just clear wear clothes out. Most places won't take donations if they don't have any life left.

I like buying new clothes. I grew up poor and often had few clothes, all ill-fitted or worn out. I also hate to waste clothes, and I cringe when I see an item above $50. I think it is okay to allow yourself to indulge from time to time, but most people will choose to get cheaper clothes in order to get more bang for their buck. It's also so hard to really know when the price tag truly correlates with quality. I've bought very expensive clothes than wore out faster than stuff I got from Walmart. There's also something to be said here about the sticky poverty trap... sometimes people are aware of problematic sellers but need clothes and can't afford to splurge. Sustainable clothing is an investment that not everyone can make. I know there were times that I cherished cheap fast fashion items, took good care of them, and tried not to feel to guilty. 

I think it does come down to person choice, we'd all love to live lives completely removed from  unethical and predatory business practice, but it's okay to be realistic and realize that some of these things are so ingrained in our society that you have to take part of some of it unless you want to build a log cabin off the grid and never do anything ever again. It's quite the connundrum and I'm no expert... you've got to balance personal efficacy with how far you want to go to prevent unethical production. Personally I avoid companies that I know are bad, go to ones I know are good (when I can afford it), but I generally do go by what is most economical for me because as I mentioned it's hard to know the truth about every random company.

I wanted to compare this to food, too. There are so many problems with mass farming, but it is quite a privilege to be able to grow your own food and only buy high quality, organic stuff. Most people want that but that doesn't mean they can start buying 1/3 as much food as usual. Clothes is a little different because it's part luxury, part utility, but I think the idea still applies. It's a weird line to walk; I am not going to suffer if I don't get a new work dress, but my quality of life can improve from having a nice wardrobe and I may not have the opportunity to take the high road there

Sorry if this reply was all over the place, I'm at work and this is just kind of a brainstorm"

But a point I’ve seen made many times while reading countless articles about clothing manufacturing ethics and sustainability is that by definition, fast fashion is bad because it’s not made to last and is made for mass consumption. Trendy pieces and cheaply made pieces made to last maybe a season or two. 

So where does that leave the consumer who has a closet full of items purchased at fast fashion retailers, but rarely makes new purchases and many of their current pieces have remained in their closet for years? 

Obviously the issue is layered and nuanced. Sure maybe I have a fast fashion t shirt that cost me $3 that I’ve gotten three years of wear out of, but obviously a $3 shirt wasn’t made sustainably or ethically. But is there a point where the trade off of ethics and sustainability becomes worth it? 

Is the “fast fashion” buyer who makes new purchases maybe a few times a year and keeps that clothing for years better or worse than the “mid range” clothing buyer who buys clothing monthly (or maybe even more?) and gets fewer uses out of each article of clothing? 

This topic bothers me because I feel like there’s no good choice unless you have $$$ to spend on the few brands that are sustainable and ethical. Is Aritzia or J Crew that much better than Forever 21 or Fashion Nova? Is the clothing quality that much better that it warrants a 300%+ price increase? Are their ethics/sustainability practices better?

Even luxury and designer brands have questionable histories, like Chanel. 

It’s just so frustrating! I feel like in the last year or two in particular there has been a sharp uptick in clothing “boutiques” and online only clothing stores which just muddy the waters further & make the shopping process that much more confusing for the average consumer. 

I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts on this matter! This has been bugging me for forever and no one IRL I know wants to have this conversation.

ETA: I just want to include that for the time being I’ve decided to predominantly buy secondhand and have been buying clothes through Vinted pretty much exclusively for the last year, until I can find other options I am comfortable with :)",2021,"The most sustainable choice is the one that is already in your closet. If you already own something that wasn’t made ethically or sustainably, there’s no benefit in trashing it if you still like it and can use it. In a similar vein, there’s already so much clothing out there, that buying something second hand that’s still in good shape is often an option.

I think aritzia and j crew are still fast fashion, just more expensive fast fashion than old navy or forever 21- they’re still introducing tons of new products and feeding in to the consumerist drive to have the newest things. 

No one is perfect, but we can strive to reduce our impact on an individual scale and aim to reduce our purchases, focus on buying used when it’s possible and try to purchase ethical and local when it’s not. 
I definitely am not perfect on this front, but I try and buy from consignment shops as a first choice when I want something, and I’m working to choose smaller brands that have clear supply chains and ethical manufacturing. If it’s made in Canada (where I’m from) then that’s awesome. 
At the end of the day I hope that my fashion choices exploit the least number of people and has the lowest environmental impact possible, and often that looks like me telling myself I don’t really need the new thing, even if I think it’s amazing and really really want it"

ETA: I just want to include that for the time being I’ve decided to predominantly buy secondhand and have been buying clothes through Vinted pretty much exclusively for the last year, until I can find other options I am comfortable with :)",2021,"I’ve thought about this as well and there’s a couple conclusions I’ve come to. 


First of all, I buy a lot of secondhand, but most if not all secondhand clothes started their life as fast fashion. I have secondhand clothes from Uniqlo, anthro, urban outfitters, etc. and the pieces were meant to be trendy at the time but they fit my style and I can get a lot of use out of them. But they were made firstly as fast fashion. 


Second, fast fashion uses a lot of synthetic fibers such as polyester, which sheds tiny particles and makes it into the ecosystem and affects plants and animals. This is bad, and no matter what you buy if it’s polyester, acrylic, nylon, etc it will do this. 


But you can’t just throw a frankly huge amount of clothes away, because it won’t degrade for a long time and throwing away those clothes would require new replacement clothes. I think the only answer is that our pattern of consumption and our definition of fast fashion have to change. Owning 200 sustainably made silk dresses is fast fashion because the production and resources to make that many dresses to be owned by one person is excessive, and those dresses may only be worn a handful of times during a lifetime, which is similar to someone buying a forever21 dress and ditching it after a few wears. The silk dresses will decompose faster and not shed micro fibers, but also silk, cotton, linen, and other natural fibers still take a lot of resources to make and require pesticides and fertilizers. 

Basically I think in a perfect world, we would be able to stop producing new cloth for clothes for years and either buy existing clothing or rework existing clothing into new clothes. Fast fashion should be redefined as a use of resources vs just pointing a finger at certain companies. I know that changing the entire fashion industry into essentially a thrift flip or using existing fabric stocks is an insane proposal that would never really be economically possible, but all current fashion  production no matter the brand or material takes a lot of resources to make and if you’re concerned about it the best thing to do is buy less, buy secondhand, repurpose secondhand, and own your clothing for as long as possible."

Of course, there are are ethical retailers out there that have lower prices, but if you are young and/or poor, there is a certain amount of fast fashion that you need to buy because it fits your price/budget. Even though it isn’t ideal, not all fast fashion is gone in a couple years, if you are buying less trendy pieces you can wear for a while.

Many things I’ve bought from fast fashion retailers I’ve had for years - I haven’t changed my height or weight much in over 10 years, so I have tops from Old Navy I have had for 10 years and other clothes that have lasted way past 5 years.

Reducing consumption is a key part of ethical fashion and even if you buy it from a retailer that is cheaper because that’s what you can afford, if you keep it a long time and don’t buy a bunch of clothes all the time, you are reducing demand and helping the environment."

It's good that you're keeping and using what you buy for years (no matter what the brand), so that's a start.

Synthetics are made of plastic and can release microplastics into the environment when they are worn and washed. Cotton takes up lots of land and water. Leather lasts way longer than pleather but then you have the cruelty aspect and tanning leather does require a lot of harmful chemicals. Expensive doesn't always mean ethical, but ethical clothing does tend to cost more. There is always going to be a footprint - not buying anything at all is probably the safest and most sustainable way but obviously we still need things now and then! 

It's taken me YEARS to change my habits and transition to a better wardrobe, and even then I'm still not fast fashion-free. I had to wait to use up what I had and be able to afford something better. It took time to refine and define my style to determine what pieces would give me the most mileage. Each person will have to determine what is important to them when it comes to sustainability. Like, I'm not very picky about my purses but I tend to vet my shoes and what my options are when it comes time to repair or dispose of them."

ETA: I just want to include that for the time being I’ve decided to predominantly buy secondhand and have been buying clothes through Vinted pretty much exclusively for the last year, until I can find other options I am comfortable with :)",2021,"Would highly recommend the book [Fashionopolis](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/554229/fashionopolis-by-dana-thomas/) to OP and others who are interested in the topic -- it dives into the ethical (e.g. labor) and environmental effects of the fashion industry and what the way forward could look like (spoilers: it's not buying all of your clothes from Everlane or other ""sustainable"" brands). It's a very interesting book that profiles people doing some really interesting work, from a company that distresses jeans in a more environmentally safe way to designers working on 3D printed garments.

My personal POV is that the most sustainable thing you can do is buy less -- but there are many (myself included) who are interested in fashion and don't want a closet of exclusively ""timeless basics"" but want to sometimes swap things in and out and try out new styles. So I try and limit true ""impulse purchases"" (like, oh I bought this sweater because I saw it and thought it was cute, but then I brought it home and realized it's not my style and never wear it) and buy more secondhand. And then on top of that, I am trying to take better care of my clothes so that they do last longer, and if there are things that I want to cycle out before their time is up then they're in a condition where I could potentially donate or resell them instead of throwing them out.

As many have said in this thread and on others, it seems like the price-quality relationship has broken down for most women's clothing -- you can get a decently-made T shirt at a fast fashion store and a poorly-constructed pair of pants from a designer brand -- and both brands may have underpaid workers making their clothes, and similar environmental impacts. As a consumer I think it's basically impossible to shop 100% ethically (or even close) so it's about trying to find the incremental changes you can make while also pushing for systems to support more fundamental changes (e.g. environmental regulations)."

Walking into this movement, the best thing you can do is keep the clothes you already own, and wear them often. Going forward, make thoughtful purchases for gaps in your wardrobe -- not as replacements for clothes that are already serving you. 

I got into sustainable fashion about two years ago. A lot of the people in that community are super privileged and/or have shopping addictions. People binge and purge on a regular basis to pay off credit cards, or they keep buying more even though their closets are ""full"". Someone in that community told me yesterday that they are setting a goal of ""only"" spending $200 a month on clothes, which they estimate is ""only"" one piece per month. Is it sustainable to consume at that rate, no matter where your clothes are coming from? 

Also -- even the ""sustainable fashion"" companies have transparency issues, sizing bias, and worker's rights controversies -- and it's a deep rabbit hole that really feels like no matter what you buy, there's an ethical dilemma attached. 

It's obviously ""complicated"" but not as complicated to get started as people make it out to be. Buy fewer, better things -- which, as a goal, includes wearing out the clothes in your closet before replacing them. Plan purchases, shop secondhand when you can, cherish (and most important -- actually wear!) what you have."

If you already have a closet full of fast fashion, taking good care of it and using it for as long as possible is the most ethical choice.  I'm in the same boat.  I'm doing a year of no new clothes/shoes purchases (only thrifted/poshmark) and I'm trying to only get things that are high quality and will last, even if they are used.  

Most of these online clothing boutiques (at least the ones I see on Poshmark/Facebook/Instagram are not sourcing ethically produced items.  I'm sure there are some that are, but they all seem to have the same stuff and you can tell just from the photos that it's cheaply made.  Again, I haven't seen every online boutique there is so I'm sure there are some out there that are fine."

Rather, it is quite literally the constant push of more and more clothing releases. I would assume the only reason most Teddy Fresh customers don’t have a significant amount of items is because of the high price tag, rather than the company not being “fast fashion.” Fast fashion is the concept of companies persistently pushing new things in customers’ faces, persuading them they need to catch up on a new style, and with only a limited amount of closet space, people will ultimately donate or throw out “outdated” clothes. Unfortunately, the vast majority of apparel donated to charities or thrift stores still do end up in landfills. I would love to some how get in touch with the company and discuss environmental sustainable practices and solutions if they are interested on how they can stray away from fast fashion."

also how long they’re working on it is great and all but if it’s a drop every month, you’re still creating a full line for every month … it’s just offset, there’s no logic there.

there’s better less deflective ways to defend TF"

i've been watching h3 since they were still in Israel and there isn't a podcast episode i've skipped, though i've skipped segments hosting people i dont care to see. I've never bought a single Teddy Fresh product, but i felt the quality in person back when they were still sold at Zumiez. There have been things i've wanted, but they sold out really quickly. 

From what i can understand without really knowing the management structure and HR practices of the company, i can only assume the company is a good one to work for, though what really matters to me is how the clothes feels, looks, fits, and it's price. the moral standards behind the company is beyond me and i couldn't be fucked and/or sucked to look into every company who gets my dollar.

that being said...;

i had to google the definition of ""fast fashion"", and i just have to say... what the hell does Ethan or Hila know or care about Magic: The Gathering? That collab came out of left fucking field, because Ethan and Hila has never, ever talked about MTG from my *YEARS* of watching them. It looks like the cards they picked were picked just because they looked cool. 

[Earl Of Squirrel](https://teddyfresh.com/products/tf-x-magic-the-gathering-earl-of-squirrel-tee) is cool looking card, it's a neat little character for people who dont know MTG, but it's basically a meme with how useless it is. also, it just looks like it was a shirt bought at walmart, with how it's literally just [the card art](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/154762/magic-the-gathering-launch-party-and-release-event-promos-earl-of-squirrel-draft-weekend?country=US&utm_campaign=18142757028&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=&utm_term=&adgroupid=&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAyKurBhD5ARIsALamXaGYBpOOqn4ISKHs00QxQBEEjbPT7Bqv-YrM1EDGzvmEbaE2w14MZQ8aAl4TEALw_wcB&Language=English) transferred to a shirt. 

[Reanimate](https://teddyfresh.com/products/tf-x-magic-the-gathering-reanimate-sweatshirt) sweatshirt is a cool art style, but i guess you can really thank Robert Bliss for that, the person who designed the card art. the sweatshirt is so bland and the text looks like it was randomly pasted on. whoever was responsible for that really just [dulled down the card art](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/5684/magic-the-gathering-tempest-reanimate?country=US&utm_campaign=18142757028&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=&utm_term=&adgroupid=&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAyKurBhD5ARIsALamXaHex5XnJxaRPP0uPfiJu-FlK_qOsqGFCHFYw8Ce91ws59Bu8JEbCWIaAq-6EALw_wcB&Language=English) and put the most basic references of it on a sweatshirt

who in the hell wants to wear [Serendib Efreet](https://teddyfresh.com/products/tf-x-magic-the-gathering-serendib-efreet-tee) merch? it's a [shit card](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/118737/magic-eternal-masters-serendib-efreet?xid=pi57b5781f-b6ac-4e43-8fe6-6a5bad608da8&Language=English&page=1). magic players dont care about the card, random people who dont play magic dont care about the card. who is this for? this is for magic players who'd wear it ironically or people who're admitting with a bullhorn that they're posers.

how about some cards from the Mox Set? easy bangers there, especially with TF style they used for the collab. Chrome Mox, Mox Diamond... but lets say MTG said ""only do cards that were still modern and currently printed"" ( i know that wasn't the case with the 1997 Tempest: Reanimate, but..) how about do clothes for Commander sets, modern sets, standard sets and get the most iconic art from those sets. even the basic lands would look great. Everyone likes and plays Soul Ring, there's a lot of creative opportunity there. and Unsets? The quality in clothes is probably ok and the designs dont look bad, but this MTG collab didn't have any input from actual MTG fans. To be fair to Teddy Fresh, there isn't a lot of other options for official MTG merch that are on good quality clothes. after searching what ""fast fashion"" meant, this almost fits the bill, with how lazy the designs felt, with how the card art was copy-pasted on some clothes or blown up to cover the shirt. all they had to do is ask some genuine magic fans/players about which cards to use, assuming wizards of the coast let them have that creative liberty. 

this isn't a gatekeep. as someone else said (about literally the same topic), ""im not a hater. I'm 'booing' because i *want* to cheer"". they almost had a customer out of me because of that collab, but for that price they charge, they need to work harder on the designs.

The problem is fast fashion brands pump out new collections every couple of weeks. And thats bad for the environment.

TF definitely pumps out more collections than luxury brands who generally have only 2 per year: Fall/Winter & Spring/summer. TF does lots different collaborations, remakes of their old collections and other collections on top of the seasonal collections. So in this sense, yes TF is a fast fashion brand. 

TF should be compared more to Zara, or H&M. Quality clothes, but they also do lots of different collections per year and are considered “fast fashion”

EDIT: Seems like people are not applying logic to what I wrote and are focusing on E-E times and that quality is better than H&M/ Zara. The environmental problem is with how many collections they are dropping, which is also one of the staples of fast fashion (lots of drops throughout the year). Instead of buying clothes only through their Summer or Winter drop, like high-end brands do, you end up buying clothes from 8-10 collections per year. More collections = more clothes in the landfill"

No whitewashing from you or them will change the reality of two super wealthy people trying to become more wealthy for the benefit of themselves and their ethics are highly suspect for the company. Which I would say is fine, no one has to buy it obviously, but they also can't defend it by trying to logically argue otherwise. Eat the heat and move the fuck on. Or don't fucking do it. The clothes are cool and everything but without the audience and famous acquaintances promoting the brand, it would have never even happened let alone succeeded. It's practically grifting for their major money maker but it is still their audience mostly. I'm sorry but it is what it is. I don't shed tears over the moral dilemmas of rich people and I don't think others should either. They'll make their money and they'll uselessly try to defend it. If they shut up they'll sell more."

I might say it’s even ‘faster’ than H&M and similar. They all chase trends but you will find them quicker in Zara than other shops. Zara is far from sustainable no matter how many beige tags they produce (same as H&M)

To quote a website ‘Zara used to produce a few collections a year but now introduces more than 20 collections, with a design-to-retail cycle is five weeks; replenishment of best-selling items takes two weeks. Zara stores get new products twice a week. (TWICE A WEEK!) H&M releases 16 collections each year, with production times varying from a few weeks to six months;

I am not even going to talk now much better the quality was 10-15 years ago. You can’t compare it to what they do today. I used to be able to walk in Zara and find an outfit head to toe, with shoes and a bag. Now the designs are questionable but the quality is much worse and prices are much higher."

But that is just the cusp of their problematic business model. They notoriously fly product development and designs teams to fashion weeks all over the world to copy and recreate these looks. Essentially, they are all stealing and mass producing other brands designs. It is more frustrating to me when they steal from independent designers who are mostly women trying to break into the industry. 

It was founded by Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega. No other retailer can compete since they own and produce everything in Spain, where as other competitors outsource everything. The entire supply chain is owned by the retailer which helps expedite turnover. 

If you do wind up purchasing from any fast fashion retailer, I would encourage you to first checkout Poshmark. Not only will you save money, but you are helping these fast fashion clothes find a second life and not get discarded or thrown away. This is more sustainable than shopping fast fashion directly.

(so basically cheap plastic)  are going to be fast fashion stores.  
Apart from the material details, you should also look at the stitching. You will find a lot of loose ends with fast fashion brands. 
Also you have to think about their prices. You won't be able to find t-shirts for 10 eur/usd with slow fashion brands. 
These extremely low prices are only possible if you use cheap materials,  exploited labor, and mass production. 
Any company that will have new products every 2 weeks is fast fashion.

Sustainability masters student here. Lots of good comments about Zara and I just wanted to add my 2 cents. It’s hard NOT to buy fast fashion these days with how affordable it is (I mean, I’m a student and broke as fuck so I can’t afford much else). There are definitely slow fashion brands out there, but they’re usually quite cost prohibitive. 

The main issues with fast fashion are unsustainable production practices and “trend chasing” which leads to overconsumption. Even most eco friendly brands are still not as eco friendly as they’d like you to believe. Look up greenwashing if you’re not familiar! The best thing you can do to reduce your ecological footprint is to just reduce your consumption. Nobody is perfect, and one person’s consumption habits isn’t going to single-handedly solve climate change. But if you get away from the mindset of needing to keep up with trends and overall purchase less clothing, you’re doing great! 

Bottom line: Zara isn’t great. But neither are a lot of other fashion brands. If you really care about your impact, only buy what you need."

Just toss it. Our trash belongs in our landfills. Not in South America or Africa or Asia. So many donations that aren't sellable or sold just get pawned off to countries who don't have the resources to dispose of them and create a whole other problem that didn't used to be there...

I'm kind of inclined to think so, with a note of the important distinction between style and fashion. But I want to know what you think.",2019,"My main two gripes with ethical clothing when purchased new from an ethical retailer are size inclusivity and a very limited style availability.

Ethical clothes seem to be offered only in straight sizing and only for a woman who is neither short nor very tall. I have not, with the exception of Eileen Fisher who has a petite range and Elizabeth Suzanne whose pants I believe come in a few inseam lengths, seen any retailer offering a line of clothes in petites, in tall, or for plus-size women. It is not enough to just tell someone ""well, have your pants shortened, yay I just solved all your problems."" You cannot easily tailor the rise of pants, where breast pockets or details fall on a shirt, and shoulder widths. There is a fine line between oversized and too big. I personally need petites sizing due to my height because clothing sized for a regular woman often *just does not fit.* I live in a moderate-sized city and thrift/consignment stores will very rarely have petites clothes, so thrifting them locally isn't always an option. There's Poshmark/ThredUp, but now you have to have the items shipped, and then the discussion shifts to the environmental impact of shipping and transportation.

In addition, most ethical clothing brands tend to have a particular ""look"" with minimalist colors (white, black, gray, and perhaps one or two muted colors) and detailing. The clothes are generally plain, and oversized/boxy. Interest is usually added with structural details and item construction. However, the ""minimalist look"" is just as trendy as anything else nowadays. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a minimalist style, but it's hilarious to think that spending $300 on a pair of ethical pants means that they are going to be above any trends and won't look out of place in a future fashion landscape. An oversized, boxy t-shirt is not timeless. Wide-leg crop pants and mom jeans are not timeless. These are items that have come in and out of fashion over the years, and are not items that were considered fashionable for the masses until trends in pant silhouettes began changing recently.

I think there are a lot of people that would be interested in ethical clothing, but either can't because of their size, or won't because the style isn't for them. Until ethical fashion is able to expand its size range to cover more women's sizes and provide a wider range of styles, fast fashion retailers are still going to exist and be some of the only places people can find clothes that they both like and fit into."

I mean, sure, you can head to the thrift store, but if you need something quick or are an unusual size, that’s not always an option. I try to buy most of my things second hand, but for whatever reason, it’s not always an option.

I know plenty of people that would love to buy more sustainable clothes. But paying $50+ for t-shirts, or hundreds of dollars for shoes just isn’t an option. If you have kids, it’s even worse. Thrifting is time consuming and not an option if you’re working more than one job while also taking care of kids and a household. 

Not to make this political, but one of the biggest reason these kinds of places are thriving is because people don’t make enough money to shop elsewhere, at least in the US. Wages are stagnant while the cost of everything is going up. If you are struggling and need clothing, sometimes the brand new stuff you can get at Forever 21, Walmart, etc. is the best you can do, if that. Not to mention, it can feel good to be able to buy a pretty dress that will take your mind off your struggles. And let’s face it, when you’re struggling with paying your bills, you don’t have the luxury to worry that the people that made your clothes have it worse."

When I said that makeup is a form of self-expression for women, I was called a Nazi sympathizer.  

What draws people to fast fashion is the prices.  (In the US), most people's salaries have not kept up with inflation, and necessities like housing and medical care are rising faster than inflation.   However, a higher price does not necessarily mean that the garmet is better quality, or even made in different conditions (the 2013 tragedy taught me that had high end and low end brands made in the same factory).

Lastly, the slow fashion (for lack of a better term) does not fit my sense of style.  It is mostly ill fitting and in muted colors.  It is either hippie grandma or very minimalist (ie Everlane) and there's a huge lack of color.  

I have Forever 21 and H&M pieces in my closet that I've had for 5+ years.  THe key when buying at places like that is (when possible) shop at their brick and mortar store and inspect the quality before buying.  I've seen a lot of things that looked cute, but didn't look like they'd survive one wash, so I didn't buy them.  This is why I'm always reluctant to buy clothes online.

I remember when I was a kid the Gap changed their merchandise like 6 times a year. I remember that I always loved the New Years stuff for Spring after the Christmas merchandise was on clearance. It was always navy, white, with red and raincoat yellow and always made me very happy.

(Sidenote: have previously worked in retail- homegoods, and also UO and Anthro)... So Gap would maybe stock like 150-200 SKUS for each season-

The pipeline for fashion changed, and Inditex/Zara had a lot to do with revolutionizing how quickly clothing could go from getting inspired by a runway to design to the sales floor in shorter and shorter amounts of time (10-15 days!) .

[THIS](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregpetro/2012/10/23/the-future-of-fashion-retailing-part-1-uniqlo/#28b7e63552f1) Forbes 3 part series describes most of this process in detail. Good read.

&#x200B;

So basically stores like H&M and Zara now produce something like 10000 SKUs a year!  Technology, cloud computing and software has made this possible. WIth the advent of Instagram and Hot! New! Lewks! coming around the corner every minute- the agitation and thirst for more! and MORE! and NOW! is really really hectic.

&#x200B;

My thoughts:

&#x200B;

1. Fast fashion does not equal Crap.There is a movement called [The 30 Wears Campaign](http://www.thesustainableedit.com/the-30-wears-campaign/) that encourages you to not throw something out until you hit thirty wears. Doesn't matter if it is your favorite Forever 21 purple floral skater dress that cost $15 or your $215 Elizabeth Suzann potato sack pants (LMAO). Any garment can be considered ""slow fashion"" if you can wear it that many times.
2. Fast fashion CAN be crap.Learn to look at the fabric content, inspect the seams, inspect the buttons, see if the lining is breathable, see how the straps are attached, look at the care requirements, do the hand test (squeeze it and see if it wrinkles) and be super critical with the fit/cut, and then IMAGINE yourself wearing that item 30 times. If you don't think it will last 30 wears- reconsider. If you don't think you will wear it more than 5 times- reconsider. But If all of those things are a GO then buy it and enjoy the HELL out of it!
3. Care about human rights.Imagine being a 13 year old or a 22 year old or having to work for menial wages and you have to sew  [$12 leopard print bicycle shorts all day](https://www2.hm.com/en_us/productpage.0740427002.html). Just imagine how much of that $12 is going into their pocket. It's probably about 10%. Is your trend thirst worth it?
4. Circular economy-Secondhand is good, Poshmark, ThredUp, Ebay is great but I hear you above when you say ""BUT IM A MOM"", ""BUT SHIPPING!"", ""BUT SIZES!"" ""BUT COST!""  I hear ya. Maybe get online and organize a clothing swap with folks nearby in your size range. Go to H&M but consider buying only what you can feasibly wear 30 times and skip things that are too flimsy, will not launder well or have a limited trend shelf life.
5. Reduce the Demand!I am not saying that H&M and Zara (et al) need to go AWAY- but if we buy less, consider MORE, and get them to reduce their CRAZED supply chain (which- lets' face it is not in HUGE DEMAND- hence the massive amount of discarded waste clothing) then maybe they can reduce their 10,000 SKUs to 6,000. Maybe then they can replace less, have larger size ranges, higher quality and better working conditions.
6. Stop Shopping for Fun/ Impulse Shopping.  
Shopping a a hobby/ activity has become ingrained into society as an activity that becomes NORM. Re-evaluate how you spend your time and money.  Re-evaluate how even small ""fun"" purchases at F21 (or wherever) impact this system. Consider your purchases slowly- even if it is from a ""fast fashion"" store. If I see a shirt I LOVE (say- at Zara) and I cannot immediately imagine 5 new outfits/ ways to wear it/ style it- I wont buy it. If it looks A LOT like another shirt I own- I won't buy it. (Halo Effect is REAL Y'ALL)... If I am buying something for ONE specific event- but I own plenty of suitable things for that event- I will no longer buy it. If I STILL DON'T KNOW- I will walk away to think about it. Go look around the mall some more. If i forget about the shirt- great! No worries didn't need it. If i keep thinking about it- AND can come up with 5 outfits and meets the quality/ fit/ 30 wears requirement I will buy it. If i go back and it's sold out- well- it wasn't meant to be. Impulse buying/ Shopping as a source of Fun is not that fun anymore. 

Sorry for rambling and getting all bullet- pointy. I think about this stuff a LOT- I think there are solutions for things, but for everyone who makes excuses for what they buy and from where- that the power is in the hands of the consumer.   


We can do better inside this system as consumers.   


You don't have to have a boring monochrome ""slow"" fashion wardrobe to be conscious, green and thoughtful. Be a smart, empowered consumer.   


The big fashion giants are not going to change their ways because we're mad, it will only be because we are mad AND they can feel it in their pockets."

But I want to know what you think.",2019,"Social media plays a huge role into the fashion industry in general. There’s a lot of “influencers” that advertise fast fashion companies (looking at you Fashion Nova) and they look glamorous. There’s also YouTube hauls. These Youtubers have massive amount of clothing in one shopping trip, more than what they can ever wear. The clothes are trendy, affordable, but most likely low quality. They try to sell you the fantasy which a lot of their followers want to attain. Worst part of all, most people watching them are younger girls. And so the cycle of fast fashion begins.

There are the opposite end of influencers who do promote sustainability. Fast fashion clothing is fine when it lasts a very long time and it was already in your wardrobe. When it comes to buying, thrifting is usually the first option; buying new pieces from ethical/small brands is the second option; buying in fast fashion brands is fine, as long as the clothing will last a long time and will get a lot of usage.

In general, we should strive to consume less and recycle clothing."

I buy stuff that has lasted over time, and I try not to buy fast-fashion if I can help it. I try to focus on quality, but sometimes I just buy cute stuff from thrift. I always re-consign things I am sick of. I buy a lot of second-hand leather, which will literally last the rest of my life. Reducing consumption of *new* items can help. Be a mindful shopper. Also, a lot of trends go around and come around (leg warmers, 80s clothes, the dresses from the 60s, etc). Could also repurpose things. Buy items that can be repaired (strong materials instead of the really cheap stuff).

If you're going to buy new:

- Look into the brands. What kind of labour do they use? 

- How far was it shipped (ie. gas to ship it)?

- Is it quality? How long will it last?

- Will you wear it for life, or just a season or 2?"

Like someone else on this thread, I'm very petite, so it's difficult to find clothing in thrift stores that fits me (nevermind that I actually LIKE).

It's also cheaper to find something at a thrift store that fits in places that are hard to tailor (like shoulders or hips) and then alter the rest to fit me.

Simple basics like shirts I'll go to uniqlo for, and more complicated things that I can't make yet (like a button up blouse) I do at least try to get ethically sourced.

I own a vintage clothing shop and I'm an avid thrifter and I work for Eileen Fisher. So that's my ""eco cred"" out of the way :P 

Here's my issues with the intense pressure to shop high end ""wear it for life"" or ""investment pieces"" vs. fast fashion: 

Just the other day I was thinking about how many mid-range mall items I have ruined by accident. Coffee stains, falling on pavement and tearing an unfixable hole in it, pitting them out (before I switched to deodorant only), catching fragile embroidery on something, and on and on. Now imagine I saved up for a $400 special piece and I get a big black grease streak on it Day 1 from getting out of a car wrongly (happened to me!). Aside from the expense of trying to dry clean it, what do I replace it with? What do I wear instead? I only have the one coat, as it was my ""investment piece"". What happens if it can't be repaired or cleaned? How many times does this happen before one decides it's not worth it? 

On that same idea, trends or even overall ""styles"". Let's imagine you the consumer have a clothing budget of $200 for the season. If you do the ""right"" thing and get second hand stuff it's likely to be just slightly ""off"" trend wise (wrong length, wrong heel shape, etc). But if you invest in one trendy item, that can be up to half your budget unless...you're doing the Forever21 route. 

What happens when you gain or lose weight, or your life circumstance changes? What about the slightly more shallow idea of just your style changing?

Same with unusual, one of a kind, or highly detailed items. Most ethical investment pieces are *bland as hell*. Sure, you can do vintage for the fun statement stuff. But that's not accessible to everyone. My vintage store ONLY carries size L and above and I sadly can't find anything above a 2X and even 2X is rare. I am working overtime here to make sure people can find vintage for them but I'm only one person! 

**And don't even get me started VETTA CAPSULE I'M GLARING AT YOU on how ethical clothing brands don't even carry size XL and they tend to look much better on tall, willowy, ruler shapes GOTDAMMIT**

I also feel that on a less serious note, there should be a balance of fun, frivolity and pleasure in fashion because fashion is a type of art. There's so little joy in life as it is. There has to be a way to make ethical consumption of fashion and style joyful again. Vintage and second hand scores is part of that, but the industry really needs to do more to match the fun and playful side that fast fashion brings."

I live paycheck to paycheck. I’m plus sized. I’m currently working on losing weight. I don’t have the option to buy expensive brands that are cost-prohibitive. Many don’t come in anything except a small range of straight sizes. Most thrift stores do not offer a wide range of clothing in my size. Due to my income level, I hold onto fast fashion for several years, until I wear it out (or until my size changes). 

I think most people buy “fast fashion” not because they want to replace their whole wardrobe year-to-year, but because most Americans, at least, can’t afford anything else. This is one of my biggest problems with lists of all the things individuals can do to help the environment - there are many that aren’t feasible for most people. The environment has to be saved by regulations on companies that cause the problem, and/or by increasing wages enough that people can make these decisions. To put the burden solely on consumers’ shoulders, when many already feel powerless about where they shop, is not okay."

Those two things will make any fast fashion item last nearly twice as long and still look good. Not everyone can afford to purchase high end clothing, so it’s all about making what you have last. And if the fashion industry is going to be unethical in manufacturing, then the least we can do is take ethical precautions by reducing the amount we buy, reusing the clothes we already have for as long as possible, and upcycling those pieces that don’t fit in your wardrobe at a second hand store. Or recycle them where possible. I know h&m has bins for recycling cloth.

3/4 of my wardrobe is Plato’s closet, and the rest is a mix of American Eagle and H&M. The only things I’ve gotten holes in are jeans/thin shirts I’ve had for anywhere between 4 - 8 years."

Honestly the biggest problem I’ve found is that so few textiles are affordable and professional. Linen  for example is reasonably priced and sourced, but the wrinkles are a big turn off for most business settings, especially meeting customers. 

Ideally it would be great for fashion to become more sustainable and ethically driven, but until then buying second-hand, increasing lifetime of items, making your own clothes, and dropping big bills for ethical brands just seems to be our only viable options."

I have an aesthetic that is curated but I don't necessarily follow modern fashion trends although I think it's quite obvious that modern fashion always borrows from past decades.

&#x200B;

I've been thrifting for the last 9 years now and my most recent fast fashion purchases have been just a week ago because I wanted a simple white shirt and couldn't get one so I caved and went to h&m. I felt badly while doing it but reconciled that I haven't participated in this industry for almost a decade. However, the problem with stores like H&m is that it is a business in fashion, and fashion trends are quick to fade. Very few of the items that they sell are classic or lasting in its stylistic appeal. It's why they have seasons and collections but this mass overconsumption that leads to consumers looking for the next best thing is why we're in the shit.

&#x200B;

People need to consume less, not just fast fashion but generally. We see the earth and its resources as infinite and the ease that we're given in getting what we want is the problem. No one wants to inconvenience themselves or go out of the way to take an extra step that's going to cost them more time. In this capitalistic system our time is our most treasured commodity, it's why people don't really make simple things themselves anymore, rather we buy them in the store. It's the same with the fashion industry, except it is wholly based on desire and rarely ever at all necessity."

Luckily there are a lot of good secondhand options now, you can get all kinds of things off the various resale sites. That doesn't work with socks and underwear, though, and even t-shirts feel weird to me to buy used, so those things I try to buy from ethical companies. My big problem is pants, those I can't buy from measurements alone, I really have to try them on, and I find in-person thrift stores overwhelming and unnavigable. So I try to buy them only when needed and shell out whatever money it takes, but I know I'm lucky to be able to.

In the end, I don't think this is something that can be solved by individual choice. The clothing production system in our economy is deeply sick, and there is no virtuous purchasing pattern that can fix that, we need to pressure the companies into better practices. Directing our anger about the horrors of the system towards individual consumers is a waste of energy that could be spent forcing the companies to make meaningful improvements."

“Fast fashion worn slowly”. Buy well made items, take care of them, and wear them for as long as possible. And go thrifting.",2022,"A few thoughts: 

1. When trying to make ethical consumer choices, sometimes you have to focus on one thing. At the very least you have to acknowledge that there are multiple issues and sometimes a product will meet one standard and not another. A company that uses all-natural fabrics may be mistreating their workers. A company that has good labor standards may not be environmentally friendly. Sometimes things that you think are safe aren’t —for example, “made in the USA” doesn’t mean “treats workers well” if those workers are prison laborers making under minimum wage. This can become really overwhelming and I suggest starting with one area you really care about rather than trying to cover everything. 

2. Check out r/buyitforlife to find brands that are likelier to last. Do read the comments in a thread because sometimes there is debate about whether a brand is actually Buy it For Life, or different products will have different quality despite being made for the same company. 

3. Think about which items of clothing you want to prioritize. I will buy cheap cotton socks and underwear because those things wear out even if they’re high quality and it’s good to have a lot of them. I will absolutely invest in quality shoes because I have a history of plantar fasciitis and need to treat my feet well. I’ll buy good quality leather belts and add holes to them when I gain or lose weight. But I never spend more than $20 on a pair of sunglasses because I’m liable to lose or break them. Your own standards for these things depend on your own needs and preferences."

For your sake, I would think of fast fashion as items that would wear out quickly and that are usually trendy. So, to avoid those things, you can search for types of clothing rather than avoiding brands. That means…buying more expensive items (not ridiculously expensive, but pricier for being able to own them for longer), durable clothing like leather, canvas, heavier jean, cotton, etc, and avoiding items that would look dated by next year (unless you LOVE it-don’t deny yourself enjoyment). A shortcut for finding these items would be shopping at department stores for their variety and buying from outdoorsy stores like LLBean or Eddie Bauer. You can also extend clothing life by taking extra care of your clothes, and if you are going to shop at a store you think is fast fashion, just buy what you need and do the best you can to take care of it. Some things are out of our control."

I've been reading Good On You for about a year and I've learned that the clothing industry just isn't perfect, and it's nearly impossible (and prohibitively expensive) to build a wardrobe from **perfectly** sustainable stores. It's better to find clothes from company that are **reasonably** sustainable than to give up on the whole affair. It's a little more work, but now that I understand the impacts, I can take a lot more pride in what I wear. I even dress like more fun/bold/experimentally now than I used to because I have more confidence that the clothes are most likely not terrible for the environment or created unethically."

“Fast fashion worn slowly”. Buy well made items, take care of them, and wear them for as long as possible. And go thrifting.",2022,"Also a Midwest resident here. Can you link to the list you found? It’s easy to conflate “fast fashion” with “unethical business practices”, because fast fashion is inherently unethical by many measures, but there are brands that underpay their workers and damage the environment without being regarded as “fast fashion” in a fashion-cycle sense. The latter understanding of fast fashion has everything to do with trends and nothing to do with the ethics and sustainability of a company. This is why Birkenstocks being on a “fast fashion” list reads as odd, because Birkenstocks are the opposite of fast fashion—they’re a timeless sandal look that folks have been wearing for decades and will probably keep wearing for decades. 

If you’re asking how to avoid “fast fashion” as in unethical business practices…..that’s honestly a toughie. Searching for things like organic fabrics, sustainable business, sustainable fashion, etc can help, but the truth is most businesses get sketchy somewhere along the line. There are issues with thrifting, too, since folks who truly rely on goodwill to fill their closet get beat out by folks with more money who are just looking for a good fashion deal. It’s kind of no-win, so your best bet is, indeed, to do what you do and minimize your purchasing overall so that you’re not engaging in the market more than you have to. 

If you’re looking to avoid fast fashion from a fashion-cycle perspective, it sounds like you already do that. Next time you find yourself in need of shopping, you can look for stores with “elevated basics”, like Talbots, Eileen Fisher, JJill…these are all kind of “old lady” stores but I like them because their clothes are high-quality, last for years, and have their own understated style that doesn’t really go with the trend of the moment. Or you can just get a v-neck t-shirt from target because I do that too and those last me 5+ years. Hope that helps!"

“Fast fashion worn slowly”. Buy well made items, take care of them, and wear them for as long as possible. And go thrifting.",2022,"I think some alarmist articles are conflating terms. Technically ""fast fashion"" can mean anything not ""slow fashion"" (ethical, sustainable, small batch, etc) or couture. That leaves...not much. 

But most of us consider ""fast fashion"" to be chains like Zara, H&M, Forever21 and so on--clothing stores that have no seasonal schedule, and churn out dozens of small ""collections"" per month---and have thousands of options a year. There is little or no consideration for ethics, sustainability, quality, etc. 

Now some people on this subReddit will start using that term for Banana Republic and J. Crew because it's not a certified B corp and they don't use 100% linen and market their stuff like Everlane does. But I personally don't consider them to be in the same category as ASOS or SHEIN or Alibaba drop shippers. Are they ""slow fashion""? No. 

But I think that the goal here is to overall reduce consumption and be thoughtful and take good care of your clothes and the world as best you can. If that means buying a $30 pair of jeans from Macy's and keeping them for 4 years, or repurposing them when they don't work anymore or if it means doing a small capsule wardrobe from Vetta or Ace & Jig, I like to think it's a spectrum and a practice, not a one and done or prescription."

“Fast fashion worn slowly”. Buy well made items, take care of them, and wear them for as long as possible. And go thrifting.",2022,"The issue with fast fashion is more about how people treat it. They buy trendy items, wear them a few times, and then leave them in the bottom of the closet, or donate, or even trash them. Then they go and buy new stuff, and the cycle repeats. All this takes resources: water, energy, fossil fuels (especially to make manmade materials like polyester & to transport it around the world) etc.

It doesn’t have to be like that. You can buy items from fast fashion retailers and use them for a long time. I have dresses from Zara and H&M that I’ve worn for more than 10 years. My oldest pair of Zara boots made it 8 years (they were solid leather and I wore them throughout winter, every year) before they were worn through. I regularly wear my H&M t-shirts over 100 times (I know precisely because I track what I wear every day) before they get irreparable holes or stains & need to be tossed.

The secret is a) knowing your style & what you actually wear, so you don’t accidentally buy something that goes to waste; and b) buying in materials that last - I prefer cotton, wool, linen etc over polys, and I take care to wash them with cold water only. 

In general, making your “fast fashion” clothes last longer beats buying “ethical” fashion to wear only a few times. Of course, if you can afford it, it’s a good idea to support locally made brands etc over “fast fashion” - but remember that just because something is more expensive, it’s not necessarily “more ethical”."

Someone dropped r/ethicalfashion in here, and I second that. I don’t remember their rating system, but you could look up brands you like on [Good On You](https://goodonyou.eco) to start collecting info about their business practices if that’s something you care about. I made a [small website for myself](https://going-gray.com) and friends/family of sustainable brands I’ve found and liked. 

I think slow fashion often gets intertwined with ethical and sustainable, because many of those companies try to make long lasting, high-quality clothes along with good business practices ([ADAY](https://thisisaday.com) is a good example). Workers are paid better, so quality is often better from material selection and production. I consider slow fashion to be good businesses selling good products. Ethics and sustainability are important to me too, so they get included. Hope this Sunday afternoon ramble helps you!"

But I find that shaming women and folks in the lower socioeconomic classes rather than the systems that create those environmental impacts and foster poor working conditions in the first place is counterproductive. And you can't entirely avoid the system if you want to stay clothed.

There's no ethical consumption under capitalism, so if you want to be a conscious consumer, you've just got to do the best you can with what's available to you. That could mean keeping clothes longer, trying to buy higher quality clothes, thrifting when you can, supporting companies that pay their workers fair wages, and avoiding short-lived trends that won't last long."

It IS possible to avoid fast fashion but it takes a bit more effort because as you said, almost every well known brand is fast fashion. Considering the terrible conditions in which the makers of these close work, we should avoid fast fashion whenever possible.

If your local thrift stores aren't any good, I would try online ones like thredup, poshmark, mercari and depop. You can even search for a particular item from a fast fashion brand and find it in good condition. 

There are also ethical brands you can use to buy new clothes but they tend to be more expensive. The one I use for underwear and stuff is pact. It's not perfectly accurate but goodonyou is a good source to see if it's an ethical brand."

“Fast fashion worn slowly”. Buy well made items, take care of them, and wear them for as long as possible. And go thrifting.",2022,"Personally, I feel that simplifying it to 'fast fashion is bad because cheap' does us a disservice and there are degrees of issues when it comes to fashion and the environment. I think magazines and the news etc. paint fast fashion as 'fast' because it's cheap or we wear it once and throw it away. But IMO that misses the the biggest environmental issue with 'fast fashion' and that is the cycle of micro trends etc. which creates masses of waste and pollution. It's not so much that the clothes don't last (Although that is obviously an issue with brands such as Shein, Misguided etc.) but that they are made to follow micro trends that become outdated quickly, thus encouraging more consumption and more waste.

For example, say there's a trend of faux-fur skirts going around online - the brands see this and quickly create a bunch of faux-fur skirts to take advantage of the trend. But the trend only lasts for a month and then faux-fur skirts are passé. The brand hasn't sold all their faux-fur skirts so they are then put on sale and if they don't sell at the sale, they're dumped into landfill. Rinse and repeat with the next trend. 

It's all well and good saying 'buy better quality clothes' or 'buy secondhand' or 'rent your clothes' but ultimately, we need to stop the waste at the source and a large part of that is encouraging people to buy stuff that is versatile and can be worn for many seasons as opposed to things that are on trend. 

I personally think the best thing we can do as consumers if we're trying to be sustainable is to try and buy clothes that will last us both physically and from a trend standpoint, whatever that item may be. Think about how versatile an item is, can you wear it in different ways? Can it be worn in various seasons? Is it repairable? Can it be fixed when it breaks? etc."

More sustainably produced fashion like Reformation, Sezane, Arq, Big Bud Press...they still market frequent drops to induce a fast fashion mindset—that you need to buy new things every season. My approach is to be very mindful about the kinds of clothes I actually wear and how long they last in my closet. I try to shop secondhand before buying something new—e.g. I buy a lot of stuff secondhand from sites like Depop and Poshmark, which also saves some money. Even if it is from a ""sustainable"" company, I avoid viscose/rayon/bamboo/other dry-clean-only because I inevitably ruin them. But I have linen, cotton, and silk pieces from fast fashion brands like Uniqlo that have lasted me years. In a similar vein, I have noticed that some brands that used to last really well, like Anthropologie, have declined in quality and fall apart on me. So yeah...consume what you need, look for something secondhand before buying new, make informed choices about what makes sense for you and your lifestyle, and take good care of your things."

Usually the good stuff I buy are made of 100% cotton, or are from a special collection. The good items, though, are so worth it. I have a few pairs of pants/jeans, and cotton tees, dresses, that are very good quality and are staples in my closet.

I don’t like H&M as it’s no different from buying from Shein imo with quality and nothing I have got has lasted.

I've got a handful of older H&M pieces that survived my wardrobe overhaul of 2019.  I've also picked a few things from there since:  I'm super picky about how things feel, but if I find something I like, that I know I'll wear to death, and the material feels dense, it usually holds up, no problem.

Old Navy, I've never actually shopped at, but I've thrifted ton because the fit works for my body shape really well, and they use a lot of 100% cotton and rayon, which I like.  

I also have a few things from Asos back from summer of 2015, when I first really tried my hand at online shopping.  A places were doing an inventory clear out around that time and I bought from a couple different places, all of which had pretty quick turnover.  For Asos, I was trying out their petite line and made use of all the videos they had to make sure I liked how things moved, and I still have all those pieces and feel cute as heck in them.

I want to say Target too, but they feel like they're the most hit and miss?  I've had things that survived to be practically ancient (specifically, some dresses, and a pair of studded, faux leather, winklepickers that have yet to scuff or lose studs) but also total duds (faux leather loafers that scuffed almost as soon as I took them home, pants that I had to resew in the wash.)  I don't know if you've got to stick to a specific line or something, but there don't seem to be as many reliable indicators that whatever your getting is decent, as most other fast fashion brands.  If they weren't one of the few places I could actually find pants that fit and one of the few stores not an hour away, I would be done with them already."

h3h3productions,,"Fast Fashion Allegations: Teddy Fresh’s manufacturers also supply Zara, Zara Kids, ASOS, Walmart and Alibaba",,2023,"This post doesn't prove whether Teddy Fresh is fast-fashion or not. It proves that some of their pieces share manufacturers with fast-fashion companies which isn't necessarily relevant.

The underlining issue of fast-fashion is the poor quality. A quick search for reviews shows that Teddy Fresh is praised for its quality whereas fast-fashion brands such as Zara or ASOS consistently get negative reviews about their bad quality.

The quality for the most part comes down to the material used which also affects the cost of manufacturing. Just because they are made by the same manufacturer it doesn't mean the same material is used. Quality control as they receive the clothes in their LA warehouse also plays a role in the quality a buyer will experience.

I also find it funny that in the same link they shared as proof that the dog hoodie factory is non-air-conditioned you can very easily find photos that prove that to be false. [Here](https://cdn.cloudbf.com/thumb/format/mini_xsize/upfile/73/images/74/20210910135408700.jpg.webp)'s such a photo where there's clearly an air-conditioning system installed.

It's also fact that the facilities Teddy Fresh uses have been certified by three separate 3rd-party auditors and they abide the global standards for ethical labor practices."

books,,Discuss: Is TikTok Is Turning Books Into Fast Fashion?,,2023,"I don’t think it’s so much tiktok as it is the publishing industry that exploits the hype of BookTok. 

Like the upcoming Sarah J Maas release that has 5 different editions with special chapters in each, incentivizing people to buy all 5 copies that 10 years down the road will probably end up in the landfill. 

The recent Red Tower release and the massive amount of misprints that are leading people to exchange books (fair enough), which means they have to reprint and ship out more books because they rushed it to capitalize on the hype. AND I just saw that they are planning on releasing a holiday edition of Iron Flame that just came out two days ago. 

So many special edition covers that get released and improperly packaged then arrive to the consumer slightly damaged and are then exchanged for pristine copies. 

I don’t begrudge people for wanting perfect copies of books when they are spending up to $100 on them, but I do wonder what is done with the slightly damaged copies and the environmental impact the publishing industry is having. 

TLDR; overconsumption is a problem and the publishing industry isn’t exempt from it.

EDIT: I admit I didn’t read the article before writing my comment and I was surprised that it focused more on the improper use of Gaelic since the comparison was to fast fashion.

Yes, TikTok is a powerful marketing tool, and yes, the world is changing. But ""fast fashion"" books have existed for *generations.* As a more recent example, think of all the supernatural romance books that came out after Twilight, or the dystopian books that came out after The Hunger Games.

europe,News,Fast fashion: EU Europe plans fast fashion crackdown,,2022,"fast fashion is one of those markets i hate because just to make the same shirt with a tiny difference in the draw it has there are families, children included, that are getting exploited. I would like they do something similar for the processed food market where big companies pay local farmers in third world countries, yet their kids have to work for their parents because evidently their parents are not getting paid enought to afford hiring other people. But i see it hard to happen since 10 companies own almost the totality of the market."
europe,News,Fast fashion: EU Europe plans fast fashion crackdown,,2022,"I fear this may have some unforeseen effects.

A small part of why fast fashion is cheap is fabric quality. Most of it is from the logistics behind it. But if you up the thread counts in fabric to comply with durability standards, you massively increase the environmental impact. Especially if it's from natural fibers. Ironically enough, yarn from petrochemicals is far less carbon intensive than natural fiber yarn like cotton or linen (mostly from the energy and water required to farm).

But if it only costs slightly more, people will still want to buy new clothes so we end up with a situation where we end up having minimum impact on how many clothes people will buy but cause much more environmental impact based on a feel-good policy.

Basically, you have to think the vast majority of people buying clothes in fast fashion are doing so because they have nothing else at home for this to be impactful. This just doesn't seem true, it's mostly people who want to have latest styles and just have something ""new"". And if that's the case this will have a negative environmental effect."

However, thrifting has become shockingly expensive. Second-hand places like goodwill and salvation army are out here charging new-clothes prices on things that were donated to them *for free*.  

No joke I took my nephew to Salvo to find some ""filler"" clothes for school. Kid grabbed 2 pair of pants, 3 tshirts, a windbreaker, and I grabbed a pink scarf.  I wasn't paying close attention to price tags, thinking it was going to total around 30-40 bucks. She rang me up $86.  I was like, *cough* I'm sorry,  what?  They had a tag of $35 on a USED windbreaker with a hole in it.  $7 for a scarf with a Greenbrier International tag (Which means it's sold at Dollar Tree stores for $1), $13 for used jeans, etc. 

I apologetically declined to purchase, and we put everything back. I'm not paying the same price for used fast fashion as you pay for new fast fashion.

Reddit, thoughts?",2023,"Your boyfriend does realize that the VAST MAJORITY of clothing brands are fast fashion right?

Are all of his clothes purchased from clothiers who stitch each garment by hand? This can get very very expensive very quickly, and isn't a viable option for some.

This isn't some new thing since the rise of Shein and FashionNova it's been around for as long as clothing has been being mass manufactured. He would be hard-pressed to find ANYONE in his life that doesn't own at least one fast fashion item.

I do think it's best practice to avoid hoarding tons of ultra cheap clothing and splurge on fewer higher quality, better manufactured garments from more ethical brands. But for many people that is not affordable, or accessible. Your bf needs to get off his high horse and check his closet because I guarantee he has things in his closet that are fast-fashion, and he's just hopping on the hate bandwagon without fully understanding what fast fashion is."

My issue with fast fashion and other big brands is the greenwashing. I don’t care if fast fashion brands are bad for the environment, all industry has a negative effect. But I would prefer if the jobs stayed in Europe and it would also make for a smaller carbon print due to transport distances, regulations and so on. 

Everyone is allowed to have their own boundaries. I just know that the few people I’ve met who are that drastic about things, they are not people I want to have around in my life :p

Life is a series of sequences and events and each event adds weight to our belief systems. Sometimes people are just incompatible and this may take years to manifest. 

Lastly my personal opinion is this is just sad because love or what it is supposed to be is compassionate and forgiving. Never demanding.

vegan,,Vegans should boycott the Fast Fashion industry,"The two causes are so interconnected. You have an industry that's built on the backs of exploiting workers in developing countries under poor conditions. It's also low barrier to entry since we already vote with our dollar on food and clothes we buy and need to extend it to fast fashion brands.

Here are some more reasons:

1. Environmental impact: Fast fashion is one of the most polluting industries globally, with high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, and waste generation. By reducing consumption and opting for sustainable and ethically sourced clothing, vegans can contribute to protecting the planet and its inhabitants.
2. Labor exploitation: Fast fashion relies on cheap labor, often in developing countries, where workers are subjected to long hours, low wages, and unsafe working conditions. As a vegan, supporting fair and ethical labor practices should be a priority.
3. Alternative options: There are several vegan and sustainable fashion brands that prioritize ethical and eco-friendly practices, offering high-quality and stylish alternatives to fast fashion. By choosing these options, vegans can align their values with their consumer choices.

Overall, boycotting fast fashion is a way for vegans to extend our commitment to animal welfare to other areas of their lives, contributing to a more compassionate and sustainable world.

I just don't believe it should be included under vegansim or seen as an expectation of vegans.

It's a bit like going to feminists ""include men too!"" And it kind of just dilutes the movement and what the message is about.

In this case, veganism is about the animals.

We can do better by going plastic free, zero waste, second hand clothing, ditch fast fashion, etc etc etc. But it shouldn't be part of veganism. There are other movements for these things specifically. 

...

My concern mainly is that by adding this idea that veganism includes not buying fast fashion, it would exclude many from the movement. And make it feel like there's too much involved = overwhelmed.

The poor can easily go vegan because plant based foods are often the cheapest globally. But... when it comes to clothes poor often rely on fast fashion because they can't afford better quality.

So absolutely we shouldn give up fast fashion if we can. But it shouldn't be an expectation of all vegans."

Now, as a vegan, I understand not all vegans think like that and many have nuanced understandings. However, the hate in response to this post is quite alarming.

Edit: Great website for researching sustainable brands and also to discover fast fashion brands: https://goodonyou.eco/",2023,"This is generally true with some caveats, as other have mentioned: eg if you're poor and unable to reasonably obtain clothes another way. These are mostly the same caveats to veganism - it's not expected of you to bankrupt yourself in travel costs or work time missed to travel outside of your food desert if you live in one.

I think this point could be made a 'higher order' so to speak. The logic of carnism used by the animal ag industry is the same as any exploitative industry under capitalism, the difference being that animal agriculture has one the least concessions because animals cannot self advocate. To me it then follows that, parallel to carnism (as it is parallel to racism and other institutions of division and oppression), capitalism must be opposed as it's very logic is to be unethical in the pursuit of profits. Thus the 'higher order' point I would put is that everyone who agrees with the logical systems of veganism, should also agree with *a* system of anti-capitalist reformism or revolution.

I think this is a better way to put it because then we can have a principled stance on industries in general without wasting time describing and debating each one (although this is useful for outreach), and we can instead use the time to discuss what the best thing to do about it is.

I think the tacit implication of OP's post is that we should buy 'ethical' or second hand clothing. The first is expensive and often not possible for a population who have had their labour value stolen from them by their employer, and the second would not be so cheap if half of the inventory wasn't fast fashion, ie if fast fashion was dismantled without dismantling capitalism poor people would no longer have access to cheap second hand clothing."

Edit: Great website for researching sustainable brands and also to discover fast fashion brands: https://goodonyou.eco/",2023,"This is a more complicated issue than it seems. I'm not saying it's an unworthy cause - I don't necessarily disagree with you - but it can't be an expectation. Veganism can already be prohibitively expensive in certain areas, and this tends to be an argument people use against veganism. ""Well... if you care about the animals so much, then why aren't you doing x, x, and x...""

Completely avoiding fast fashion is a lot harder than just ""oh, don't shop at Shein or Forever 21,"" which have become easy to identify and point the finger at due to the rapidly shifting styles and low price point. However, there are a LOT more stores in the fast fashion business and it can be hard to even differentiate between which brands are or aren't at times. Price point alone isn't even a good indicator. Someone can think that buying a $60 shirt definitely can't be contributing to fast fashion because it's $60, but it isn't necessarily true. Boycotting fast fashion, if we were really getting into the nuts and bolts and researching every company on the shelves, would mean boycotting buying clothes in general. It would mean doing most purchasing online because very few brick and mortar stores carry 100% sustainable and ethically sourced clothing. 

Thrifting can reduce impact, but unfortunately now thrift stores are becoming overrun with these fast fashion pieces too, and the rise of people going ""hunting"" to resell items has driven up prices. It's harder to find quality items, and harder to get a deal. When I lived in Boston, for example, the Goodwill was more expensive than buying new clothes from the Walmart in my hometown in suburban MA... Recently, my local Savers had a Shein shirt that cost more than it had probably cost brand new on Shein. Speaking of thrifting... as a vegan, is it problematic to thrift clothing that is not vegan? I don't say this to incite you, because I don't know the answer either. 

Now I'm not saying it isn't worth cutting out some of the worst offenders. Every little bit helps. But I think a better tactic, aside from making your own clothes, is just being more selective about the pieces you are buying and reducing your consumerism as a whole. Ask yourself, ""is this just a trend? Will this still look good in 5 years? Do I really love it?"" 

If you are someone in a position to ONLY buy sustainable brands with proven ethical labor practices, and they make them in sizes that fit them and styles that you like, then do so. But I don't necessarily think it should be an expectation or qualifying factor of veganism. I like to think that most people who ascribe to the vegan lifestyle for the ethics are already trying their best to limit their impact in other areas. Our society really makes it impossible to be totally perfect."

vegan,,Vegans should boycott the Fast Fashion industry,"The two causes are so interconnected. You have an industry that's built on the backs of exploiting workers in developing countries under poor conditions. It's also low barrier to entry since we already vote with our dollar on food and clothes we buy and need to extend it to fast fashion brands.

Here are some more reasons:

1. Environmental impact: Fast fashion is one of the most polluting industries globally, with high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, and waste generation. By reducing consumption and opting for sustainable and ethically sourced clothing, vegans can contribute to protecting the planet and its inhabitants.
2. Labor exploitation: Fast fashion relies on cheap labor, often in developing countries, where workers are subjected to long hours, low wages, and unsafe working conditions. As a vegan, supporting fair and ethical labor practices should be a priority.
3. Alternative options: There are several vegan and sustainable fashion brands that prioritize ethical and eco-friendly practices, offering high-quality and stylish alternatives to fast fashion. By choosing these options, vegans can align their values with their consumer choices.

Overall, boycotting fast fashion is a way for vegans to extend our commitment to animal welfare to other areas of their lives, contributing to a more compassionate and sustainable world.

malefashionadvice,Article,Putting fast fashion out of fashion,,2022,"One of the major problems with heritage clothing simply being reduced to an aesthetic was that many companies that emphasized ethical production along with long-term durability had their niche co-opted by companies that just exported their production abroad to murky supply lines. Companies like Alex Mills and many of the Huckberry brands exploited an opportunity and were able to undercut a bunch of really forward-thinking companies. Now that heritage is considered passe, we're seeing so-called streetwear and many other current styles place no emphasis on ethical production. I think it is really important that people re-discover the values that brought people to heritage in the first place."
malefashionadvice,Article,Putting fast fashion out of fashion,,2022,Is there a list of high quality sustainable brands that I can check on when considering my next purchase. Especially if they are available in Europe.
malefashionadvice,Article,Putting fast fashion out of fashion,,2022,"I've been saying this over and over again that I just don't believe that when it comes to male fashion, fast fashion is not driving mass growth in sales. The average man when given the option to buy cheaper clothes do not buy significantly more clothes, they spend less money on clothes. 

&#x200B;

[Look at the source article this article quoted](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/style-thats-sustainable-a-new-fast-fashion-formula) \- 

>The number of garments produced annually has doubled since 2000 and exceeded 100 billion for the first time in 2014: nearly 14 items of clothing for every person on earth

&#x200B;

14 items of clothing per person per year. To literally put that into perspective, last week I bought three pairs of socks and 2 pairs of underwear, that's more than half my ""share"" of clothing for the year already.....

&#x200B;

But let's dissect this number further - In 2000, the world population was 6.14 billion. In 2015, it was 7.43 billion. In 2000, 25% of the world lived in poverty (World bank definition of $1.90 inflation/purchasing power adjusted dollars a day), so 75% didn't live in poverty. This means that the non-poor population of the world in 2000 was 4.6 billion. In 2015, 12% of the world lived in poverty, so the non-poor population of the world was 6.54 billion. 

&#x200B;

I'm going to assume that people in extreme poverty aren't buying commercially produced clothing. They get hand me downs or self-produce (which technically does still consume cotton/wool, etc). Thus, per capital clothing consumption went up 41%. 

&#x200B;

Consider the following two factors now:

* What percentage of growth was driven by people barely above the poverty line getting richer? IE: if you went from making $2/day to $5/day, you rightfully should be consuming more. 
* What percentage of growth come from women?

&#x200B;

I don't have the data to prove it, but I'm willing to bet that the growth in clothing consumption is most likely driven by women and people getting lifted out of poverty. Not high-income individuals (of which all of us here count as) buying shit loads of clothing because it is cheaper."

malefashionadvice,Article,Putting fast fashion out of fashion,,2022,"It's very hard to find easily accessible information on every brand. I'm no 100% sustainable and ethical buyer, however I look out for certain things. 

- Country of origin. If it's made in my country (UK) then I know workers of said manufacturer will (likely) be protected by our labour laws. Also when a company produces it's clothes in it's country of origin, it shows they care about oversight of the production process, i.e. quality. 

- Fabric. Pretty much always try to find natural fibres and avoid synthetics where possible. The fabric is dependant on what kind of clothing you're buying, but generally speaking aim to buy clothes made of cotton, wool, silk, linen, etc. Sometimes it's unavoidable, but do what you can. 

- Price. Understand what good products cost, is the price too good to be true? I know that I can buy a T-shirt that is 100% made in UK, with UK fabrics, of a great quality, for [£20](https://communityclothing.co.uk/collections/mens-t-shirts-tops/products/mensshortsleevet-shirt-white?variant=6978726854710). I also own a T-shirt from Primark, it's 100% cotton, probably around 180gsm and it's a solid T-shirt all around. It cost me £9, because they outsource production to third would countries. 

My go-to's when I know I want a solid, hard working piece of clothing are [Blacksmith](https://www.blacksmith-store.com/pages/our-values) and [Community Clothing](https://communityclothing.co.uk/). 

Still on the hunt for similar brands and retailers. To echo what's been said in this thread, buy used. I get the majority of my clothes used and it really opens you up to great quality at good prices that you know is doing good for the world by repurposing old clothing."

In the Netherlands it was the most trendy store, with huge lines outside it during sale season. It didn't seem to be considered too expensive by most girls I knew, since lots of them shopped there.

What is its reputation in your country?",2022,"Spaniard here, I guess I can give an insight as to the reputation of Zara in its own home nation.

As you can imagine, it is quite a reputable brandname in the sense that it is one of Spain's most widely internationalized companies. His founder, Amancio Ortega, is known for being the richest national individual. With these premises, of course, a plethora of opinions arise, varying from those people who celebrate the company and its founder as a case of major success for the country, to those who denounce the company for labour abuses in delocalized factories around the world and Ortega himself as a tax evader.

However, I think your question has to do more with the clothing side of things, and, in this sense, I feel like it would be categorized in the middle as far as reputation goes: it's certainly not the cheapest, but it is also the main go-to store for many middle income families. Indeed, it's like the brand tries to give an impression of high end fashion at an accessible cost for people in the spectrum (and I say it's ""like"", because they are known for not spending anything in marketing, like, they never announce themselves or anything because people do already know what Zara is). But, as I was saying, they are by no means at the higher end of the fashion side of things, for which wealthier people would usually go to places such as Cortefiel and Massimo Dutti (both of which I think are owned by Zara itself, by the way).

Nevertheless, I think I understand where your question comes from; an old foreign classmate of mine once told me that Zara is much pricier elsewhere in the world than in Spain, which I found to be really curious - like, would they purposefully keep prices lower in its own nation out of special consideration? I don't know, hard to say for me; I haven't really ever gone to a Zara abroad, and they're definitely not my go-to clothing shop anyways.

Anyway, I hope this helps :)"

What is its reputation in your country?",2022,"The thing is, Zara really is inexpensive fast fashion but because we are so used to seeing crazy cheap fast fashion online brands everywhere and clothes are cheaper now than they EVER have been, it seems expensive by comparison. Which leads people to think it's can't be that bad, because it's much more costly than Shein and BooHoo et al, right? And it's a complex issue because many people that criticise these practices are branded elitists who want to take affordable options away from people on limited incomes. 

If you look back 500 years, clothes were so expensive that even rich people didn't have wardrobes like the average minimum wage person has today (purely in terms of number of outfits, not quality!). Over time clothes became cheaper as textile making became industrialised, the sewing machine was invented etc. In the 1930's a decent income for a man working full time in the US was about $30 a week. That would be something like a journalist or clerk, so many would have brought home much less. If you look at ads for clothes of the time, it was a much bigger proportion of that salary than we pay today for clothes. $10 would have been a typical amount to pay for a dress for example. 1/3 weekly salary for one garment is much more than the average person is willing to pay today.

So it's really our perspective on clothes that has changed. We aren't willing to spend what they should cost (in a fair responsible world) because society wants dirt cheap and practically disposable instead of high quality, long wearing and carefully purchased. Worth remembering that Zara is one of the fast fashion originators - previous to its rise fashion brands would release seasonal collections rather than fortnightly/weekly/daily releases like is done today. So there is a reason they are often name checked along with Shein when people talk about the worst offenders."

Fast fashion corporations in EU and US want to make as much money as possible in the shortest amount of time. The quality of fabric and methods used to make such clothes come secondary. Even high 'quality' brands that assemble clothes in EU import raw fabric from Asia (e.g. hugo boss). Just because stuff is made in asia doesn't mean it is low quality, just like stuff made in eu and us is not automatically high quality. See automotive industry or electronics; for quality and reliability, buy japanese."

I read a rapport that stated the level of lead in the clothes (residue from dying process) was much, much higher than what consumer laws in the USA and EU recommend. 

Lead is a neurotoxin that can be absorbed by the skin. Children who are exposed to high levels of lead (whether in the womb or by wearing clothes) can suffer intellectual disabilities and behavioural disorders. Lead is also stored in our brains, kidneys, livers, teeth and bones. It's dangerous, basically. 

Before you can say ""oh but I wash my clothes"" - lead is literally being flushed into our water systems where it's difficult to remove. 

There's a reason why consumer laws state what level of lead our clothes can contain. I'm not going to toy with that. Ymmv."

Generally I think that structural issues need structural solutions and are not the responsibility of individuals, but I also get the frustration in seeing fast fashion proliferate. I guess the best solution would be to add pressure on quality brands to make bigger sizes in cuts that actually work on bodies... And overturn this neoliberal capitalism that makes fast fashion both possible and profitable.
 
My own solution to the intersection of fatness and relative poverty has been to try and learn sewing. To be fair, I'm not in a place where I would need to look ""professional"" or ""normal"" or ""credible"" so that gives a lot of freedom in terms of what I can wear, and clothes looking homemade isn't a problem. I've also got loads of time and few responsibilities so fiddling about with fabrics is doable.
 
All in all it's unfortunate that this is how the world currently works."

I don't know how true this next part is, but someone on Reddit said that those brands aren't even making a profit on the clothing, they're profiting off selling your data to advertising firms. 

And I do get it about the price. I've also fallen victim to the siren song of a $10 dress. But the thing is, the shit is bad. Real bad. The fabric is always some bizarre plastic-y monstrosity that feels gross on my skin. The pieces always pull in weird places, or are way too big in one area but way too small in another. When I have bought something from there I could actually wear, I typically wear it once and never again. 

What I also don't understand is this narrative I see around plus size spaces that ""there is literally nowhere else to get things that cheap."" But all retailers, even high end ones, have clearance sections. More and more plus size thrift stores are popping up online. I also am of the philosophy that I would rather have fewer things that are high quality than a lot of things that are shitty. But not everyone is like that."

I am privileged that I am a size 18/20 so I can generally find stuff that fits in thrift stores and I can afford to buy from small slow fashion boutiques on occasion. 
I don’t do fast fashion for the environmental impact and the human rights abuses are abhorrent.
I use thredUP a lot as it’s easier for me to shop for clothes that are in my size range with a bigger selection than I’d find at the thrift store. It’s nice to be able to filter by material type as I refuse to wear polyester.

I think the biggest thing for me though is that I also mend my clothes a lot. I refuse to throw out clothes that can be fixed. I use a darning loom to fix socks, I use the sashiko method to sew up thigh holes in jeans. I dye faded or stained clothes or use dye to change the look of an item I’m not wearing anymore to make me reach for it more. 
Even if I end up with a fast fashion item, I try my best to live with the ideas of slow consumerism.

I think that sometimes we see the way that straight sized people are able to consume fashion (can always find stuff in their size, can find stuff that is temporary trends, can get a lot of thrifted stuff) and we want that too. Shein and Temu has been able to give us fat women the same sort of overabundance that thin women get all the time when they go thrifting or shopping at the mall.   


But here's the thing, that type of shopping is bad for everyone. It's bad for the environment and for the workers, but it is also bad for us as humans. We don't appreciate our clothes or take the time to mend and clean them properly (because it only cost $10 to begin with!). We don't know how to find clothes that really fit us because we only get exposed to cheap material that is stretchy so they don't have to worry about getting a proper fit. We need MORE. More closet space for the clothes we buy in amounts far larger than our grandparents did because it is cheap. We don't develop a distinct style because we just buy trends on sale and then move on to the next one when the clothes start falling apart.  


I am guilty of buying a dress because I want the serotonin hit of buying something new and it is sooooo cute. But I'm working on it. I personally don't use SHEIN or TEMU because I think their quality is terrible and their stuff has never fit me, but I'm still guilty of overconsuming because stuff is cheap. I might be buying from Target instead of SHEIN but it is still bad for the environment and workers and me. But now I'm taking time to not do this anymore. I have learnt sewing and mending so I can care for my clothes. I learned proper stain removal and washing care, and when I can't remove a stain I now over it with embroidery. That's the key. Pay what you can for high quality clothing and then care for it as long as you can. If the highest quality clothing you can afford is SHEIN then so be it, but wear it into the ground."

To be fair I’m still shopping at Old Navy, Target, etc - but it’s been made clear to me that there’s a substantial difference between the harm caused by Shein vs the harm caused by other fast fashion/cheaper corporate brands. Even then I’m trying to reduce those purchases or get them secondhand where I can. 

Plus size women deserve better - that’s a given. And obviously straight size individuals are a huge reason Shein exists bc they love cheap trendy clothes as much as plus size people do. We just have the extra layer of having significantly less options. To me personally I don’t think that’s a good enough excuse to support a terrible company like Shein. 

It’s not even like they treat their customers well, either. Didn’t their clothes have high levels of lead? Or might still? I can’t remember. And a (straight sized) friend of mine ordered some dresses from Shein and 2 of the 3 arrived with broken straps. The product you end up with at the end often isn’t worth even the little bit of money you spend to get it."

Trying to find plus sized clothing in second hand stores here in nz is also really hard to find, not to mention the lack of a car and the extreme cost of living here. 

I get the sentiment but I'm buying what I can afford.  If I do find second hand clothes I will change it up and add things to it, but f**k me you need to be rich to sew your own clothes in NZ too. Hence why I don't sew my own clothes, the cost is astronomical. If it were cheaper than I would absolutely buy from more ethical stores, I just can't  justify buying $160 plus size jeans or pay my rent.  

It's unfortunate, but when I do find the time and money go thrifting, most of the plus size.clothing are from shien or the likes of them anyway. I'd hate for someone to think badly about my outfits because I buy thrifted shien items.

Almost all my clothes I have had for years. I have things I wore in high school and I’m 34. I’ve shopped on Shein like twice. Two years later and I still have and wear the stuff I bought. The only time I buy new clothes is when they literally fall apart (I’m talking years and years of use) or my weight fluctuates. Sometimes I wonder if how people treat the garments play a role in how long their clothes last. I don’t wash my clothes after one wear and I always wash things in cold water.

The affordability and the selection available in my size has opened up a whole new world of fashion for me, which has done WONDERS for my self-confidence (something I’ve always been short on). I feel I’ve been conditioned my whole life to be ashamed of my body and to think that looking good and having confidence in my appearance would simply not be a possibility for me, but fast fashion has changed that. To add, I live two hours away from any town with shops, and I might spend a whole day driving to a town and from shop to shop to try things on and still not find anything that fits or is affordable to me.

Shein is helping me learn about my sense of style affordably, and once I’ve worn my favorite items to death I plan to replace them with high quality, sustainable versions from other companies.
In the meantime, I’m extremely careful about reading reviews and product descriptions to make sure the fit and material will be to my liking so I avoid getting things I’ll never wear or will return/discard. 

Unfortunately my shame has shifted from being about my body to being about where I get my clothes. I don’t tell people irl that I buy from Shein. I know I’m probably just rationalizing here, but I’m tired of being responsible for corporations’ bad behavior. This whole situation really sucks."

You're very wrong if you think that the boohoo group (and competitors) work on small margins. Margins for almost all items are in excess of 50%, unheard of in most other industries.

The thing that is killing them recently is international shipping and increased logistics costs across the world, as well as much higher returns than expected.

For example, returns for dresses are in excess of 50%. This is because lots of women have very different body shapes and styles, and it's almost impossible to cater for everyone with one size. The manufacturers' quality has also decreased in the last couple of years, so it's a double-edged sword considering dresses make up the most of their sales. 

Since covid, international distribution costs have increased by more than threefold - this massively impacts profit. the USA was a very good and fast-growing sector for them before and during covid, and this has also reduced due to places like shein offering quicker and lower shipping costs. This should be mitigated soon when they open US distribution centres. 

To answer your actual question, no I highly doubt it will harm them at all. People need clothes, and they will look for the cheapest available. The UK market will likely increase over the next year, but international will likely fall."

videos,,Fast Fashion Is Hot Garbage | Climate Town,,2021,Fast fashion absolutely floored me when I first learned about it.

The idea of throwing out something that you only wore once or twice is wild to me. I weary shit until stops fitting or until it gets holes and shit in it. Just. Fucking wow..so wasteful.

videos,,Fast Fashion Is Hot Garbage | Climate Town,,2021,"\>worn 7 times before being thrown out

\>purchase 67 pieces of clothing a year

Who are these people? Why are they doing this? It boggles my god damn mind.

My wife and I both still wear clothes that we've had since high school (as long as they still fit... not all do...), and we're in our mid to late 30s! Hell she has clothes from her mother back in the 60s and 70s!

And it's not like we made the choice together, or like we bonded over this shit. It was just incidental. That's what we've always done and it's only hearing shit like this that makes me scratch my head going ""WHO... WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE!?""

Thing is I think I know who they are.

My wife and I take nightly walks through our neighborhood. And when we lived in Florida (we recently moved out of state) we noticed something on garbage night.

See, garbage in our city in SoFla was picked up twice a week, with recycling on only 1 of those 2 days. Thing is we never put our garbage out both days because there wasn't enough to take out. And mind you we lived 3 and 4 people to the house (so normal family size) depending on which year it was and what roommates we had at the time. We probably took out our garbage once every other week.

But when we go on walks... a large majority of our neighbors had garbage out every single time it was garbage night. And not only that... it would be overflowing.

And we would be confused...

""WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? What are they doing to create so much garbage?""

Like it's not like I try to NOT create garbage. I'm just a regular old dude, doing regular old things. Hell... it wasn't until my mid twenties that I started recycling because a girl I dated yelled at me for not recycling. And I was like ""huh... never really thought to"" cause I was just... some 20 something year old dude who wasn't thinking past his own nose.

And this is why it confuses me.

I'm no hippy. I'm not tree hugging save the earth type. I eat taco bell, drink mtn dew, smoked cigarettes most of my life (I did quit that... I figured I survived this long might as well stop doing that shit). Hell sometimes I still throw cans in the garbage cause I missed my throw and it bounced in and I'm just like ""eh, where it lands, it stays"".

So... if my lazy, filthy, dumbass who can't be fucked to sort his garbage correctly isn't purchasing 67 pieces of clothing a year and not creating 2 overflowing garbage cans of garbage a week (which I presume contains these clothes). And I'm not alone because my wife, my roommates in the past, my friends... we don't do this.

So, I want to know...

WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE!?

\[edit\] - some how got my mind mixed up towards the end and saying throwing out 67 pieces of clothes... fixed that"

videos,,Fast Fashion Is Hot Garbage | Climate Town,,2021,"You want to help the planet? Stop buying so much crap.

Reduce is much better than Reuse which is much better than Recycle.   If you really need to buy something, then get it used and keep using it until you can give it away to someone else to use. Just because you have an Amazon prime account doesn't mean you have to keep buying more crap you don't need. 

Also support the idea of corporations being taxed for everything they produce that is harmful for the planet. Use that tax money to clean the planet. Learn from history how corporations pushed [""made to break"" products](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2006/05/origins-anti-litter-campaigns/) so that people keep buying new stuff and then pushed the responsibility of recycling onto consumers instead of big businesses.

I wear shoes until they are unwearable.

There is this overwhelming belief in the UK that only wealthy people would ever 'waste their money' buying something that isnt the cheapest possible option and they're total idiots for doing so and that there is no difference between a £2.50 pair of jeans and a £80 pair of jeans. I know people who will talk to the cows come home about how we should do more about climate change and then go on about how the wealthy are scum for buying clothes from anywhere that isnt Primark.

You dont need to shop at Gucci to buy items that aren't exploiting people and made from plastics, actually I wouldn't be surprised if the big Italian and French brands are also just as guilty, there are plenty of smaller brands based in the UK, US, wherever you live who are making things relatively locally and without ruining everything.

**Catalog Images Always Use Clips**

Last year, [ASOS faced some heat](https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/25/asos-slammed-after-being-caught-out-using-clips-on-models-dress-9318265/) when they accidentally uploaded a catalog image that showed the garment being clipped on the model. This practice is the standard across eCommerce catalog shooting. The actual reason isn’t to mislead the customer (although that is unfortunately the outcome) but it’s due to the nature of the eCommerce new arrival cycle.

Typically, company HQ only receives 1 or maybe 2 samples of every item that they can use to photograph for catalog and campaign images. These samples arrive much earlier than bulk stock in order to be photographed ahead of release, and when bulk stock is finally ready, it goes straight to warehouses or retail stores in order to save on shipping costs. Brands tend to rotate through different models who have different heights, weights, and sizes - which means they’re often too small for the sample size. Without clips, the garment will usually look too baggy or loose and will not reflect the true fitting of the item so stylists clip the item on the body then photoshop them out during retouching.

That said, it’s a bit of a hard line to draw. Sometimes stylists clip it too tightly or too loosely (only designers really know how it’s supposed to fit and they aren’t usually involved in the photoshoot process) and the result can be misleading. 

------------------


**Every Influencer Post Is An Advertisement**

If an influencer tags a brand in their photo or in their caption, they most likely were paid to do so (either via cash or via free clothing). I know this isn’t necessarily ground-breaking news, but I want to explain the depth of the system.

Most brands have influencers on rotation. One of my previous companies had 150+ each month who they would send X articles of clothing and/or cash (depends on the influencer’s follower count and country) in return for Y number of posts or Stories (sometimes we would write the caption for them). We would track engagement and clothing sales spikes to see if it was worth it to keep them on. On our roster, we purposefully would have anyone from large scale celebrities down to micro-influencers (girls with less than 2k followers but had high engagement who had potential to grow - think popular university students) and everyone in between. Only influencers who were just starting out would post for us without us giving them anything for free because they wanted to align to our brand. Over 10k followers, never. 

So yes, it is great that Instagram rolled out the “Paid Partnership” feature that makes it easier to tell what is an ad or what isn’t. But it’s actually in both the brand and the influencer’s interest to avoid the Paid Partnership feature. Brands want the posts to seem organic (it’s not cool to have to pay to be featured) and influencers do not want their feed to be solely advertisements (it’s not cool to be a sell out). Influencers will mainly choose to do Paid Partnerships if the company isn’t good for their image or if the company has a lot of cash to spare.

This, I suspect, is why Instagram is getting rid of public like figures. If you do a Paid Partnership post, the influencer grants the brand access to the data metrics (how many likes, how many people saw it, etc;) which they desperately need to track in order to determine ROI. Furthermore, Paid Partnership posts also allow brands to put money behind the post and boost it as an ad that appears organic. It’s effectively another cash grab from IG.  But both brands and influencers will continue to skirt these regardless.

**Everyone Copies Everyone… and Korea**

Brands I worked for used [WGSN](https://www.wgsn.com/en/) for trend forecasting from runways and I know majority of others do as well. They basically collate all of high fashion’s runways into a few distilled core trends per season. This is why sometimes you’ll see campaigns that are very similar from a number of brands at the same time. 

Competitor analysis is very, very real. Brands scrape competitor websites to figure out their inventory and determine if they have any gaps themselves. It is not uncommon to just straight up buy another brand’s garment and copy the pattern with slight adjustments.

This is particularly true when it comes to Dongdaemun, Seoul’s largest wholesale market. Lots of brands will either use patterns based off their inventory. Many others will actually just mark up, white label, and resell Korean wholesale market clothing. This is the case for Pixie Market (with the exception of their Made by Pixie Market section). Oh and those cheap accessories you see on fast fashion brands? Almost all of them are from Guangzhou in China.

--------------


**Greenwashing is Real**

If a fast fashion company is coming out with a CSR line, it’s not because they care about the environment. It’s because their PR department told them it was a great idea to combat any claims of them not being eco-friendly. And it’s because their merchandisers told them it was a great idea to jump on consumer trends.

That’s not to say CSR collections are bad. By buying them, you are encouraging the brand to continue to develop them. But unless environmental sustainability and fair labour are embedded within the brand’s DNA from its onset, it is most likely just a marketing ploy. The same can be said for inclusivity campaigns and banning retouching (you mean we can lay off our retouch team AND look woke? win fucking win).  

It’s worth noting that majority of brands share Asia factories with one another and conditions vary. China’s factory conditions have actually improved significantly over the years, so as a result, a lot of companies are migrated to places like Cambodia where conditions are more lenient and labor is cheaper - so be mindful of those labels. 

For what it's worth, I met a guy who works for an IGO in their fair labor division where his job was to raid clothing factories for inspection. He told me that Inditex was one of the better ones but that H&M and Uniqlo had by far the worst.

Anyway, I might be a bit cynical. I love fashion but I didn't have the best experiences working in it. I'm happy to answer any questions - but I will be avoiding any brand-identifying info for obvy reasons.",2020,Thank you for the insight on the marketing in fast fashion. I worked in e-commerce marketing for luxury jewelry as well as mid end jewelry and many practices were similar especially with the influencers. It's always mind boggling how much is just illusion and well crafted words.

It’s worth noting that majority of brands share Asia factories with one another and conditions vary.

For what it's worth, I met a guy who works for an IGO in their fair labor division where his job was to raid clothing factories for inspection. He told me that Inditex was one of the better ones but that H&M and Uniqlo had by far the worst.

**Catalog Images Always Use Clips**

Last year, [ASOS faced some heat](https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/25/asos-slammed-after-being-caught-out-using-clips-on-models-dress-9318265/) when they accidentally uploaded a catalog image that showed the garment being clipped on the model. This practice is the standard across eCommerce catalog shooting. The actual reason isn’t to mislead the customer (although that is unfortunately the outcome) but it’s due to the nature of the eCommerce new arrival cycle.

Typically, company HQ only receives 1 or maybe 2 samples of every item that they can use to photograph for catalog and campaign images. These samples arrive much earlier than bulk stock in order to be photographed ahead of release, and when bulk stock is finally ready, it goes straight to warehouses or retail stores in order to save on shipping costs. Brands tend to rotate through different models who have different heights, weights, and sizes - which means they’re often too small for the sample size. Without clips, the garment will usually look too baggy or loose and will not reflect the true fitting of the item so stylists clip the item on the body then photoshop them out during retouching.

That said, it’s a bit of a hard line to draw. Sometimes stylists clip it too tightly or too loosely (only designers really know how it’s supposed to fit and they aren’t usually involved in the photoshoot process) and the result can be misleading. 

------------------


**Every Influencer Post Is An Advertisement**

If an influencer tags a brand in their photo or in their caption, they most likely were paid to do so (either via cash or via free clothing). I know this isn’t necessarily ground-breaking news, but I want to explain the depth of the system.

Most brands have influencers on rotation. One of my previous companies had 150+ each month who they would send X articles of clothing and/or cash (depends on the influencer’s follower count and country) in return for Y number of posts or Stories (sometimes we would write the caption for them). We would track engagement and clothing sales spikes to see if it was worth it to keep them on. On our roster, we purposefully would have anyone from large scale celebrities down to micro-influencers (girls with less than 2k followers but had high engagement who had potential to grow - think popular university students) and everyone in between. Only influencers who were just starting out would post for us without us giving them anything for free because they wanted to align to our brand. Over 10k followers, never. 

So yes, it is great that Instagram rolled out the “Paid Partnership” feature that makes it easier to tell what is an ad or what isn’t. But it’s actually in both the brand and the influencer’s interest to avoid the Paid Partnership feature. Brands want the posts to seem organic (it’s not cool to have to pay to be featured) and influencers do not want their feed to be solely advertisements (it’s not cool to be a sell out). Influencers will mainly choose to do Paid Partnerships if the company isn’t good for their image or if the company has a lot of cash to spare.

This, I suspect, is why Instagram is getting rid of public like figures. If you do a Paid Partnership post, the influencer grants the brand access to the data metrics (how many likes, how many people saw it, etc;) which they desperately need to track in order to determine ROI. Furthermore, Paid Partnership posts also allow brands to put money behind the post and boost it as an ad that appears organic. It’s effectively another cash grab from IG.  But both brands and influencers will continue to skirt these regardless.

**Everyone Copies Everyone… and Korea**

Brands I worked for used [WGSN](https://www.wgsn.com/en/) for trend forecasting from runways and I know majority of others do as well. They basically collate all of high fashion’s runways into a few distilled core trends per season. This is why sometimes you’ll see campaigns that are very similar from a number of brands at the same time. 

Competitor analysis is very, very real. Brands scrape competitor websites to figure out their inventory and determine if they have any gaps themselves. It is not uncommon to just straight up buy another brand’s garment and copy the pattern with slight adjustments.

This is particularly true when it comes to Dongdaemun, Seoul’s largest wholesale market. Lots of brands will either use patterns based off their inventory. Many others will actually just mark up, white label, and resell Korean wholesale market clothing. This is the case for Pixie Market (with the exception of their Made by Pixie Market section). Oh and those cheap accessories you see on fast fashion brands? Almost all of them are from Guangzhou in China.

**Greenwashing is Real**

If a fast fashion company is coming out with a CSR line, it’s not because they care about the environment. It’s because their PR department told them it was a great idea to combat any claims of them not being eco-friendly. And it’s because their merchandisers told them it was a great idea to jump on consumer trends.

That’s not to say CSR collections are bad. By buying them, you are encouraging the brand to continue to develop them. But unless environmental sustainability and fair labour are embedded within the brand’s DNA from its onset, it is most likely just a marketing ploy. The same can be said for inclusivity campaigns and banning retouching (you mean we can lay off our retouch team AND look woke? win fucking win).  

It’s worth noting that majority of brands share Asia factories with one another and conditions vary.

I do have a question for you. When I was studying fashion merchandising years ago, we had access to a trend forecasting site that was SO fun to dig around on and felt very diverse. You mentioned trend forecasting. Do you believe that the online presence has effected trend forecasting? What does it look like now for fast fashion specifically? It seemed to be such a routine system laid out for months, even for fast fashion, but now with trends popping up left and right online is it harder to forecast or perhaps “control” the trends? 

Over the years, I’ve become frustrated with how saturated the market is with trends. Especially in fast fashion. I felt as though I was walking into the same 5 stores with near identical assortments. This has pushed me to buy online much more because I can find unique silhouettes and patterns. Which feels like I’m betraying my own industry being a brick and mortar employee. It’s such a viscous cycle! 

Another question, what do you think of the small boutiques that pop up online? I have to admit that IG clothing ads get me maybe 60% of the time."

**Greenwashing is Real**

If a fast fashion company is coming out with a CSR line, it’s not because they care about the environment. It’s because their PR department told them it was a great idea to combat any claims of them not being eco-friendly. And it’s because their merchandisers told them it was a great idea to jump on consumer trends.

That’s not to say CSR collections are bad. By buying them, you are encouraging the brand to continue to develop them. But unless environmental sustainability and fair labour are embedded within the brand’s DNA from its onset, it is most likely just a marketing ploy. The same can be said for inclusivity campaigns and banning retouching (you mean we can lay off our retouch team AND look woke? win fucking win).  

It’s worth noting that majority of brands share Asia factories with one another and conditions vary. China’s factory conditions have actually improved significantly over the years, so as a result, a lot of companies are migrated to places like Cambodia where conditions are more lenient and labor is cheaper - so be mindful of those labels. 

For what it's worth, I met a guy who works for an IGO in their fair labor division where his job was to raid clothing factories for inspection. He told me that Inditex was one of the better ones but that H&M and Uniqlo had by far the worst.

Anyway, I might be a bit cynical. I love fashion but I didn't have the best experiences working in it. I'm happy to answer any questions - but I will be avoiding any brand-identifying info for obvy reasons.",2020,">Almost all of them are from Guangzhou, China

I’m just a regular ole consumer but I’ve known this for years, and am glad that my assumptions are correct. 

People like to shit on Asian online marketplaces for making “rip offs” of fast fashion items, but are they really rip offs of the item if it’s being made there anyways?? You’re just buying the item directly from the Chinese manufacturer instead of Topshop, H&M, Zara, etc.

The image search on the AE app is amazing. Save a picture of practically any fast fashion item (ESPECIALLY accessories), and I guarantee you will find it on AliExpress for way cheaper. 

This may be a controversial opinion here but guess what, a lot of luxury brands have their items assembled or sourced from China as well. 

I watched a documentary on YouTube a couple of days ago where journalists discovered that MaxMara furs were sourced from China and the people skinning the animals were being paid about 30 USD *a day*. 

Your luxury Gucci or LV bag is assembled in China too. The last couple of steps that take place in some European country are the reason why luxury bags can say “made in France/Spain/Italy”...but they’re still mainly assembled & manufactured in China.

**Catalog Images Always Use Clips**

Last year, [ASOS faced some heat](https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/25/asos-slammed-after-being-caught-out-using-clips-on-models-dress-9318265/) when they accidentally uploaded a catalog image that showed the garment being clipped on the model. This practice is the standard across eCommerce catalog shooting. The actual reason isn’t to mislead the customer (although that is unfortunately the outcome) but it’s due to the nature of the eCommerce new arrival cycle.

Typically, company HQ only receives 1 or maybe 2 samples of every item that they can use to photograph for catalog and campaign images. These samples arrive much earlier than bulk stock in order to be photographed ahead of release, and when bulk stock is finally ready, it goes straight to warehouses or retail stores in order to save on shipping costs. Brands tend to rotate through different models who have different heights, weights, and sizes - which means they’re often too small for the sample size. Without clips, the garment will usually look too baggy or loose and will not reflect the true fitting of the item so stylists clip the item on the body then photoshop them out during retouching.

That said, it’s a bit of a hard line to draw. Sometimes stylists clip it too tightly or too loosely (only designers really know how it’s supposed to fit and they aren’t usually involved in the photoshoot process) and the result can be misleading. 

------------------


**Every Influencer Post Is An Advertisement**

If an influencer tags a brand in their photo or in their caption, they most likely were paid to do so (either via cash or via free clothing). I know this isn’t necessarily ground-breaking news, but I want to explain the depth of the system.

Most brands have influencers on rotation. One of my previous companies had 150+ each month who they would send X articles of clothing and/or cash (depends on the influencer’s follower count and country) in return for Y number of posts or Stories (sometimes we would write the caption for them). We would track engagement and clothing sales spikes to see if it was worth it to keep them on. On our roster, we purposefully would have anyone from large scale celebrities down to micro-influencers (girls with less than 2k followers but had high engagement who had potential to grow - think popular university students) and everyone in between. Only influencers who were just starting out would post for us without us giving them anything for free because they wanted to align to our brand. Over 10k followers, never. 

So yes, it is great that Instagram rolled out the “Paid Partnership” feature that makes it easier to tell what is an ad or what isn’t. But it’s actually in both the brand and the influencer’s interest to avoid the Paid Partnership feature. Brands want the posts to seem organic (it’s not cool to have to pay to be featured) and influencers do not want their feed to be solely advertisements (it’s not cool to be a sell out). Influencers will mainly choose to do Paid Partnerships if the company isn’t good for their image or if the company has a lot of cash to spare.

This, I suspect, is why Instagram is getting rid of public like figures. If you do a Paid Partnership post, the influencer grants the brand access to the data metrics (how many likes, how many people saw it, etc;) which they desperately need to track in order to determine ROI. Furthermore, Paid Partnership posts also allow brands to put money behind the post and boost it as an ad that appears organic. It’s effectively another cash grab from IG.  But both brands and influencers will continue to skirt these regardless.

**Everyone Copies Everyone… and Korea**

Brands I worked for used [WGSN](https://www.wgsn.com/en/) for trend forecasting from runways and I know majority of others do as well. They basically collate all of high fashion’s runways into a few distilled core trends per season. This is why sometimes you’ll see campaigns that are very similar from a number of brands at the same time. 

Competitor analysis is very, very real. Brands scrape competitor websites to figure out their inventory and determine if they have any gaps themselves. It is not uncommon to just straight up buy another brand’s garment and copy the pattern with slight adjustments.

This is particularly true when it comes to Dongdaemun, Seoul’s largest wholesale market. Lots of brands will either use patterns based off their inventory. Many others will actually just mark up, white label, and resell Korean wholesale market clothing. This is the case for Pixie Market (with the exception of their Made by Pixie Market section).

I read [this article](https://www.ft.com/content/5bafd9c0-235f-11ea-92da-f0c92e957a96) about retailers dealing with too many online returns.

Only influencers who were just starting out would post for us without us giving them anything for free because they wanted to align to our brand. Over 10k followers, never. 

So yes, it is great that Instagram rolled out the “Paid Partnership” feature that makes it easier to tell what is an ad or what isn’t. But it’s actually in both the brand and the influencer’s interest to avoid the Paid Partnership feature. Brands want the posts to seem organic (it’s not cool to have to pay to be featured) and influencers do not want their feed to be solely advertisements (it’s not cool to be a sell out). Influencers will mainly choose to do Paid Partnerships if the company isn’t good for their image or if the company has a lot of cash to spare.

This, I suspect, is why Instagram is getting rid of public like figures. If you do a Paid Partnership post, the influencer grants the brand access to the data metrics (how many likes, how many people saw it, etc;) which they desperately need to track in order to determine ROI. Furthermore, Paid Partnership posts also allow brands to put money behind the post and boost it as an ad that appears organic. It’s effectively another cash grab from IG.  But both brands and influencers will continue to skirt these regardless.

**Everyone Copies Everyone… and Korea**

Brands I worked for used [WGSN](https://www.wgsn.com/en/) for trend forecasting from runways and I know majority of others do as well. They basically collate all of high fashion’s runways into a few distilled core trends per season. This is why sometimes you’ll see campaigns that are very similar from a number of brands at the same time. 

Competitor analysis is very, very real. Brands scrape competitor websites to figure out their inventory and determine if they have any gaps themselves. It is not uncommon to just straight up buy another brand’s garment and copy the pattern with slight adjustments.

This is particularly true when it comes to Dongdaemun, Seoul’s largest wholesale market. Lots of brands will either use patterns based off their inventory. Many others will actually just mark up, white label, and resell Korean wholesale market clothing. This is the case for Pixie Market (with the exception of their Made by Pixie Market section). Oh and those cheap accessories you see on fast fashion brands? Almost all of them are from Guangzhou in China.

--------------


**Greenwashing is Real**

If a fast fashion company is coming out with a CSR line, it’s not because they care about the environment. It’s because their PR department told them it was a great idea to combat any claims of them not being eco-friendly. And it’s because their merchandisers told them it was a great idea to jump on consumer trends.

That’s not to say CSR collections are bad. By buying them, you are encouraging the brand to continue to develop them. But unless environmental sustainability and fair labour are embedded within the brand’s DNA from its onset, it is most likely just a marketing ploy. The same can be said for inclusivity campaigns and banning retouching (you mean we can lay off our retouch team AND look woke? win fucking win).  

It’s worth noting that majority of brands share Asia factories with one another and conditions vary. China’s factory conditions have actually improved significantly over the years, so as a result, a lot of companies are migrated to places like Cambodia where conditions are more lenient and labor is cheaper - so be mindful of those labels. 

For what it's worth, I met a guy who works for an IGO in their fair labor division where his job was to raid clothing factories for inspection. He told me that Inditex was one of the better ones but that H&M and Uniqlo had by far the worst.

**Catalog Images Always Use Clips**

Last year, [ASOS faced some heat](https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/25/asos-slammed-after-being-caught-out-using-clips-on-models-dress-9318265/) when they accidentally uploaded a catalog image that showed the garment being clipped on the model. This practice is the standard across eCommerce catalog shooting. The actual reason isn’t to mislead the customer (although that is unfortunately the outcome) but it’s due to the nature of the eCommerce new arrival cycle.

Typically, company HQ only receives 1 or maybe 2 samples of every item that they can use to photograph for catalog and campaign images. These samples arrive much earlier than bulk stock in order to be photographed ahead of release, and when bulk stock is finally ready, it goes straight to warehouses or retail stores in order to save on shipping costs. Brands tend to rotate through different models who have different heights, weights, and sizes - which means they’re often too small for the sample size. Without clips, the garment will usually look too baggy or loose and will not reflect the true fitting of the item so stylists clip the item on the body then photoshop them out during retouching.

That said, it’s a bit of a hard line to draw. Sometimes stylists clip it too tightly or too loosely (only designers really know how it’s supposed to fit and they aren’t usually involved in the photoshoot process) and the result can be misleading. 

------------------


**Every Influencer Post Is An Advertisement**

If an influencer tags a brand in their photo or in their caption, they most likely were paid to do so (either via cash or via free clothing). I know this isn’t necessarily ground-breaking news, but I want to explain the depth of the system.

Most brands have influencers on rotation. One of my previous companies had 150+ each month who they would send X articles of clothing and/or cash (depends on the influencer’s follower count and country) in return for Y number of posts or Stories (sometimes we would write the caption for them). We would track engagement and clothing sales spikes to see if it was worth it to keep them on. On our roster, we purposefully would have anyone from large scale celebrities down to micro-influencers (girls with less than 2k followers but had high engagement who had potential to grow - think popular university students) and everyone in between. Only influencers who were just starting out would post for us without us giving them anything for free because they wanted to align to our brand. Over 10k followers, never.

One of my previous companies had 150+ each month who they would send X articles of clothing and/or cash (depends on the influencer’s follower count and country) in return for Y number of posts or Stories (sometimes we would write the caption for them). We would track engagement and clothing sales spikes to see if it was worth it to keep them on. On our roster, we purposefully would have anyone from large scale celebrities down to micro-influencers (girls with less than 2k followers but had high engagement who had potential to grow - think popular university students) and everyone in between. Only influencers who were just starting out would post for us without us giving them anything for free because they wanted to align to our brand. Over 10k followers, never. 

So yes, it is great that Instagram rolled out the “Paid Partnership” feature that makes it easier to tell what is an ad or what isn’t. But it’s actually in both the brand and the influencer’s interest to avoid the Paid Partnership feature. Brands want the posts to seem organic (it’s not cool to have to pay to be featured) and influencers do not want their feed to be solely advertisements (it’s not cool to be a sell out). Influencers will mainly choose to do Paid Partnerships if the company isn’t good for their image or if the company has a lot of cash to spare.

This, I suspect, is why Instagram is getting rid of public like figures. If you do a Paid Partnership post, the influencer grants the brand access to the data metrics (how many likes, how many people saw it, etc;) which they desperately need to track in order to determine ROI. Furthermore, Paid Partnership posts also allow brands to put money behind the post and boost it as an ad that appears organic. It’s effectively another cash grab from IG.  But both brands and influencers will continue to skirt these regardless.

**Everyone Copies Everyone… and Korea**

Brands I worked for used [WGSN](https://www.wgsn.com/en/) for trend forecasting from runways and I know majority of others do as well. They basically collate all of high fashion’s runways into a few distilled core trends per season. This is why sometimes you’ll see campaigns that are very similar from a number of brands at the same time. 

Competitor analysis is very, very real. Brands scrape competitor websites to figure out their inventory and determine if they have any gaps themselves. It is not uncommon to just straight up buy another brand’s garment and copy the pattern with slight adjustments.

This is particularly true when it comes to Dongdaemun, Seoul’s largest wholesale market. Lots of brands will either use patterns based off their inventory. Many others will actually just mark up, white label, and resell Korean wholesale market clothing. This is the case for Pixie Market (with the exception of their Made by Pixie Market section). Oh and those cheap accessories you see on fast fashion brands? Almost all of them are from Guangzhou in China.

--------------


**Greenwashing is Real**

If a fast fashion company is coming out with a CSR line, it’s not because they care about the environment. It’s because their PR department told them it was a great idea to combat any claims of them not being eco-friendly. And it’s because their merchandisers told them it was a great idea to jump on consumer trends.

That’s not to say CSR collections are bad. By buying them, you are encouraging the brand to continue to develop them. But unless environmental sustainability and fair labour are embedded within the brand’s DNA from its onset, it is most likely just a marketing ploy. The same can be said for inclusivity campaigns and banning retouching (you mean we can lay off our retouch team AND look woke? win fucking win).  

It’s worth noting that majority of brands share Asia factories with one another and conditions vary. China’s factory conditions have actually improved significantly over the years, so as a result, a lot of companies are migrated to places like Cambodia where conditions are more lenient and labor is cheaper - so be mindful of those labels. 

For what it's worth, I met a guy who works for an IGO in their fair labor division where his job was to raid clothing factories for inspection. He told me that Inditex was one of the better ones but that H&M and Uniqlo had by far the worst.

**Catalog Images Always Use Clips**

Last year, [ASOS faced some heat](https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/25/asos-slammed-after-being-caught-out-using-clips-on-models-dress-9318265/) when they accidentally uploaded a catalog image that showed the garment being clipped on the model. This practice is the standard across eCommerce catalog shooting. The actual reason isn’t to mislead the customer (although that is unfortunately the outcome) but it’s due to the nature of the eCommerce new arrival cycle.

Typically, company HQ only receives 1 or maybe 2 samples of every item that they can use to photograph for catalog and campaign images. These samples arrive much earlier than bulk stock in order to be photographed ahead of release, and when bulk stock is finally ready, it goes straight to warehouses or retail stores in order to save on shipping costs. Brands tend to rotate through different models who have different heights, weights, and sizes - which means they’re often too small for the sample size. Without clips, the garment will usually look too baggy or loose and will not reflect the true fitting of the item so stylists clip the item on the body then photoshop them out during retouching.

That said, it’s a bit of a hard line to draw. Sometimes stylists clip it too tightly or too loosely (only designers really know how it’s supposed to fit and they aren’t usually involved in the photoshoot process) and the result can be misleading.

Without clips, the garment will usually look too baggy or loose and will not reflect the true fitting of the item so stylists clip the item on the body then photoshop them out during retouching.

That said, it’s a bit of a hard line to draw. Sometimes stylists clip it too tightly or too loosely (only designers really know how it’s supposed to fit and they aren’t usually involved in the photoshoot process) and the result can be misleading.

**Every Influencer Post Is An Advertisement**

If an influencer tags a brand in their photo or in their caption, they most likely were paid to do so (either via cash or via free clothing). I know this isn’t necessarily ground-breaking news, but I want to explain the depth of the system.

Most brands have influencers on rotation. One of my previous companies had 150+ each month who they would send X articles of clothing and/or cash (depends on the influencer’s follower count and country) in return for Y number of posts or Stories (sometimes we would write the caption for them). We would track engagement and clothing sales spikes to see if it was worth it to keep them on. On our roster, we purposefully would have anyone from large scale celebrities down to micro-influencers (girls with less than 2k followers but had high engagement who had potential to grow - think popular university students) and everyone in between. Only influencers who were just starting out would post for us without us giving them anything for free because they wanted to align to our brand. Over 10k followers, never. 

So yes, it is great that Instagram rolled out the “Paid Partnership” feature that makes it easier to tell what is an ad or what isn’t. But it’s actually in both the brand and the influencer’s interest to avoid the Paid Partnership feature. Brands want the posts to seem organic (it’s not cool to have to pay to be featured) and influencers do not want their feed to be solely advertisements (it’s not cool to be a sell out). Influencers will mainly choose to do Paid Partnerships if the company isn’t good for their image or if the company has a lot of cash to spare.

This, I suspect, is why Instagram is getting rid of public like figures. If you do a Paid Partnership post, the influencer grants the brand access to the data metrics (how many likes, how many people saw it, etc;) which they desperately need to track in order to determine ROI. Furthermore, Paid Partnership posts also allow brands to put money behind the post and boost it as an ad that appears organic. It’s effectively another cash grab from IG.  But both brands and influencers will continue to skirt these regardless.

**Everyone Copies Everyone… and Korea**

Brands I worked for used [WGSN](https://www.wgsn.com/en/) for trend forecasting from runways and I know majority of others do as well. They basically collate all of high fashion’s runways into a few distilled core trends per season. This is why sometimes you’ll see campaigns that are very similar from a number of brands at the same time. 

Competitor analysis is very, very real. Brands scrape competitor websites to figure out their inventory and determine if they have any gaps themselves. It is not uncommon to just straight up buy another brand’s garment and copy the pattern with slight adjustments.

This is particularly true when it comes to Dongdaemun, Seoul’s largest wholesale market. Lots of brands will either use patterns based off their inventory. Many others will actually just mark up, white label, and resell Korean wholesale market clothing. This is the case for Pixie Market (with the exception of their Made by Pixie Market section). Oh and those cheap accessories you see on fast fashion brands? Almost all of them are from Guangzhou in China.

**Greenwashing is Real**

If a fast fashion company is coming out with a CSR line, it’s not because they care about the environment. It’s because their PR department told them it was a great idea to combat any claims of them not being eco-friendly. And it’s because their merchandisers told them it was a great idea to jump on consumer trends.

That’s not to say CSR collections are bad. By buying them, you are encouraging the brand to continue to develop them. But unless environmental sustainability and fair labour are embedded within the brand’s DNA from its onset, it is most likely just a marketing ploy. The same can be said for inclusivity campaigns and banning retouching (you mean we can lay off our retouch team AND look woke? win fucking win).  

It’s worth noting that majority of brands share Asia factories with one another and conditions vary. China’s factory conditions have actually improved significantly over the years, so as a result, a lot of companies are migrated to places like Cambodia where conditions are more lenient and labor is cheaper - so be mindful of those labels. 

For what it's worth, I met a guy who works for an IGO in their fair labor division where his job was to raid clothing factories for inspection. He told me that Inditex was one of the better ones but that H&M and Uniqlo had by far the worst.

**Catalog Images Always Use Clips**

Last year, [ASOS faced some heat](https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/25/asos-slammed-after-being-caught-out-using-clips-on-models-dress-9318265/) when they accidentally uploaded a catalog image that showed the garment being clipped on the model. This practice is the standard across eCommerce catalog shooting. The actual reason isn’t to mislead the customer (although that is unfortunately the outcome) but it’s due to the nature of the eCommerce new arrival cycle.

Typically, company HQ only receives 1 or maybe 2 samples of every item that they can use to photograph for catalog and campaign images. These samples arrive much earlier than bulk stock in order to be photographed ahead of release, and when bulk stock is finally ready, it goes straight to warehouses or retail stores in order to save on shipping costs. Brands tend to rotate through different models who have different heights, weights, and sizes - which means they’re often too small for the sample size.

I used to work in retail. The company would regularly host sample sales, where I bought packs of costume jewelry for $1-5. I was appalled at the markup (even if they were technically samples!) and haven't been able to take accessories in fast fashion stores seriously since.

fourthwavewomen,FOOD FOR THOUGHT,How Shein and “Fast Fashion” Hurts Women,"So, today I checked out Shein for the first time. A lot of friends were buying from there, and I had to see what the hype was. I instead, discovered an incredibly exploitive, offensive, and cruel company that I want to discuss with you all.

Shein is a “fast fashion” company, which essentially means that they produce poor quality clothes and other products for extremely cheap. (Seriously…$4 for a dress? $1 for a graphic tee?). The thing about fast fashion, is that it relies on EXPLOITING very vulnerable populations, such as women and children. In fact, 80% of garment workers are women. One can find a $5 pair of jeans, and not even realize that the reason the jeans are only $5 is because of the long hours, low wages, and the dangerous labor conditions many women working in this industry are exposed to. The average female garment worker works 16 hours  and only takes home $2 per day. There are many cases where female garment workers and children died at work due to the unsafe conditions. A major example of this is when the Rana Plaza clothing factory in Bangladesh collapsed, and killed over 1,000 workers, many of whom were women.

Fast fashion companies like Shein don’t just harm the workers. It harms the buyers too! They feed on womens’ insecurities and bodies and idealises the fantasies instilled by the patriarchal society into their minds. Fast fashion creates an unsafe space for women and forces them into a cycle of insecurities, body image issues, creates a drive for consumption of trendy clothes to fit into the narrative created for them by the society, and accelerates self-esteem related mental health issues. It promotes a very narrow and unreasonable ideal body type, which teaches young girls and women that they are not enough unless they dress and behave exactly the way they are expected to. The target audience for Shein and similar companies is women ages 18-24. With this in mind, they sell many products tailored towards society’s beauty standards. The sites are riddled with hyper-sexualized clothes. The sites often go as far as to attract buyers to the sexualized and revealing outfits through use of models with photoshopped porn-star bodies. With social media amplifying age-old pressures for teenage girls to conform to certain sexualized narratives, many women feel pressured into purchasing these clothes to “fit in”. 

Overall, Shein is incredibly harmful to women in every aspect. To combat this, some women are deciding to support local businesses as well as ETHICAL clothing brands that actually empower women. Some women are also holding brands accountable for the way they treat their female employees and refuse to buy products from them if they choose to continue the exploitation, miserable long hours, and scanty pay.

My question for you all is, how do you feel about this? What were your experiences on fast fashion websites like? How else do these companies harm women? I’d love to participate in some dialogue about this lesser known issue!

EDIT: thank you all for the wonderful dialogue about the ethics of fast fashion. I want to address one topic that has repeatedly come up- the fact that many plus size women shop on Shein and other sites like it because it’s their only option to get cute, body inclusive, and comfortable clothes for an affordable price. I COMPLETELY understand this. My post was meant to educate people about the lesser known topic of anti-female fashion. It was NOT meant to tell you what you should or shouldn’t purchase. ALL women are impacted by patriarchal beauty standards, no matter their body type. In fact, the biggest point I was trying to drive home is that companies like Shein work to promote unreasonable ideal body types. This hurts all women, including plus size women. With that being said, In fashion, it’s a constant difficult choice between sacrificing affordability for ethics and ethics for affordability. Ultimately, it’s your body, so you should clothe yourself however works best for you and your confidence. I just wanted everyone to be aware that this problem exists. 

Lastly, I just want to stress the important of supporting businesses with size inclusivity. Size inclusive businesses promote body positivity and self love. By creating clothing that fits all body types, size inclusive businesses encourage people to embrace their bodies and feel confident in their own skin. This is a significant step towards dismantling unrealistic beauty standards that have long been perpetuated by the fashion industry. The beauty standards are the real devil of the fashion industry ",2023,"Totally agree with everything you said. I’d also add that by and large the clothes are cheap synthetic fibers that pollute the earth and end up in landfills very quickly due to the low quality of the material and craftsmanship. Fast fashion, Shein in particular, is an absolute menace. I cannot believe people waste their money on that garbage— I see it in thrift stores all the time and it is absolute trash. What a terrible waste of those workers’s time and lives."

fourthwavewomen,FOOD FOR THOUGHT,How Shein and “Fast Fashion” Hurts Women,"So, today I checked out Shein for the first time. A lot of friends were buying from there, and I had to see what the hype was. I instead, discovered an incredibly exploitive, offensive, and cruel company that I want to discuss with you all.

Shein is a “fast fashion” company, which essentially means that they produce poor quality clothes and other products for extremely cheap. (Seriously…$4 for a dress? $1 for a graphic tee?). The thing about fast fashion, is that it relies on EXPLOITING very vulnerable populations, such as women and children. In fact, 80% of garment workers are women. One can find a $5 pair of jeans, and not even realize that the reason the jeans are only $5 is because of the long hours, low wages, and the dangerous labor conditions many women working in this industry are exposed to. The average female garment worker works 16 hours  and only takes home $2 per day. There are many cases where female garment workers and children died at work due to the unsafe conditions. A major example of this is when the Rana Plaza clothing factory in Bangladesh collapsed, and killed over 1,000 workers, many of whom were women.

Fast fashion companies like Shein don’t just harm the workers. It harms the buyers too! They feed on womens’ insecurities and bodies and idealises the fantasies instilled by the patriarchal society into their minds. Fast fashion creates an unsafe space for women and forces them into a cycle of insecurities, body image issues, creates a drive for consumption of trendy clothes to fit into the narrative created for them by the society, and accelerates self-esteem related mental health issues. It promotes a very narrow and unreasonable ideal body type, which teaches young girls and women that they are not enough unless they dress and behave exactly the way they are expected to. The target audience for Shein and similar companies is women ages 18-24. With this in mind, they sell many products tailored towards society’s beauty standards. The sites are riddled with hyper-sexualized clothes. The sites often go as far as to attract buyers to the sexualized and revealing outfits through use of models with photoshopped porn-star bodies. With social media amplifying age-old pressures for teenage girls to conform to certain sexualized narratives, many women feel pressured into purchasing these clothes to “fit in”. 

Overall, Shein is incredibly harmful to women in every aspect. To combat this, some women are deciding to support local businesses as well as ETHICAL clothing brands that actually empower women. Some women are also holding brands accountable for the way they treat their female employees and refuse to buy products from them if they choose to continue the exploitation, miserable long hours, and scanty pay.

My question for you all is, how do you feel about this? What were your experiences on fast fashion websites like? How else do these companies harm women? I’d love to participate in some dialogue about this lesser known issue!

EDIT: thank you all for the wonderful dialogue about the ethics of fast fashion. I want to address one topic that has repeatedly come up- the fact that many plus size women shop on Shein and other sites like it because it’s their only option to get cute, body inclusive, and comfortable clothes for an affordable price. I COMPLETELY understand this. My post was meant to educate people about the lesser known topic of anti-female fashion. It was NOT meant to tell you what you should or shouldn’t purchase. ALL women are impacted by patriarchal beauty standards, no matter their body type. In fact, the biggest point I was trying to drive home is that companies like Shein work to promote unreasonable ideal body types. This hurts all women, including plus size women. With that being said, In fashion, it’s a constant difficult choice between sacrificing affordability for ethics and ethics for affordability. Ultimately, it’s your body, so you should clothe yourself however works best for you and your confidence. I just wanted everyone to be aware that this problem exists.

The beauty standards are the real devil of the fashion industry ",2023,"I think the issue of this runs much deeper than just Shein and other obvious garbage shops. Many people think as long as they don't buy from the obvious places like Shein, wish, Teemu, aliexpress and so on, they are doing good.

But the common chains you know and bought from, are probably producing their clothes in sweatshops. Expensive designer clothes are made in sweat shops too. Even some ""ethical"" clothing is immensely greenwashed and from sweat shops. Therefore, I think it is incredibly hard to avoid supporting this practice, especially if you don't have much money.

While there are some companies that at least reduce the amount of harm they do to vulnerable women, children and nature, their downside is often that they aren't affordable for many people. This means that often enough, it is the ""better"" option for poor people to buy fast fashion, because it will give you more options. 100 USD in fast fashion is a whole variety of clothes even if their quality is shit, whereas for many ethical labels, it's maybe 2-3 pieces.

If a woman, especially in a professional setting, is wearing the exact same outfit everyday, I am pretty sure that sooner or later, co-workers will catch onto that and it will 100% mark her as a weirdo. (Same thing might happen to a man too, but I am pretty sure a man will get away with that for longer because men's fashion is boring and there isn't as much importance on how a man looks vs. how a woman looks.)"

It's horrible that companies do this and they know they can get away with it because in those countries women have even less rights than in the first world and are lower-class citizens...so these factories could be their own way to feed their families or to help try and get somewhat out of poverty."

they know the endless consumerism and chasing beauty standard and fashion trends for women is where most of the money is made. it's made of off making women feel like they're never enough. they'll never be pretty enough. never be chic enough. never have enough clothes.

it's infuriating the way women make less money than men on average, yet we are expected to spend so much money on maintaining our appearance, because our appearance is everything. it's how much we are valued in society.

so much pressure to be fashionable and trendy and compete with other women. trend cycles are so fast they last maybe 2 weeks before the next microtrend on the internet and you have to get it first to show all your followers!

women get judged harshly for repeating outfits yet men can wear the same thing for a whole week and no one says anything!

there's a whole meme called ""over-dressed gf and under-dressed bf"" joking how the gf puts lot of effort into her outfit and the man doesn't try at all. also reminds me of the recent [pics](https://images.app.goo.gl/kzYCGnbvWFdXuiMR9)of justin and hailey bieber going to haileys krispy kreme launch event. no shade to justin but it's goes to show where we are at socially to joke how normalized this is.


getting dressed is just one in many ways that women try so hard and men don't try or use weaponized incompetence (emotional labor in a relationship, housework/chores, childcare, managing family events, etc )"

fourthwavewomen,FOOD FOR THOUGHT,How Shein and “Fast Fashion” Hurts Women,"So, today I checked out Shein for the first time. A lot of friends were buying from there, and I had to see what the hype was. I instead, discovered an incredibly exploitive, offensive, and cruel company that I want to discuss with you all.

Shein is a “fast fashion” company, which essentially means that they produce poor quality clothes and other products for extremely cheap. (Seriously…$4 for a dress? $1 for a graphic tee?). The thing about fast fashion, is that it relies on EXPLOITING very vulnerable populations, such as women and children. In fact, 80% of garment workers are women. One can find a $5 pair of jeans, and not even realize that the reason the jeans are only $5 is because of the long hours, low wages, and the dangerous labor conditions many women working in this industry are exposed to. The average female garment worker works 16 hours  and only takes home $2 per day. There are many cases where female garment workers and children died at work due to the unsafe conditions. A major example of this is when the Rana Plaza clothing factory in Bangladesh collapsed, and killed over 1,000 workers, many of whom were women.

Fast fashion companies like Shein don’t just harm the workers. It harms the buyers too! They feed on womens’ insecurities and bodies and idealises the fantasies instilled by the patriarchal society into their minds. Fast fashion creates an unsafe space for women and forces them into a cycle of insecurities, body image issues, creates a drive for consumption of trendy clothes to fit into the narrative created for them by the society, and accelerates self-esteem related mental health issues. It promotes a very narrow and unreasonable ideal body type, which teaches young girls and women that they are not enough unless they dress and behave exactly the way they are expected to. The target audience for Shein and similar companies is women ages 18-24. With this in mind, they sell many products tailored towards society’s beauty standards. The sites are riddled with hyper-sexualized clothes. The sites often go as far as to attract buyers to the sexualized and revealing outfits through use of models with photoshopped porn-star bodies. With social media amplifying age-old pressures for teenage girls to conform to certain sexualized narratives, many women feel pressured into purchasing these clothes to “fit in”. 

Overall, Shein is incredibly harmful to women in every aspect. To combat this, some women are deciding to support local businesses as well as ETHICAL clothing brands that actually empower women. Some women are also holding brands accountable for the way they treat their female employees and refuse to buy products from them if they choose to continue the exploitation, miserable long hours, and scanty pay.

My question for you all is, how do you feel about this? What were your experiences on fast fashion websites like? How else do these companies harm women? I’d love to participate in some dialogue about this lesser known issue!

EDIT: thank you all for the wonderful dialogue about the ethics of fast fashion. I want to address one topic that has repeatedly come up- the fact that many plus size women shop on Shein and other sites like it because it’s their only option to get cute, body inclusive, and comfortable clothes for an affordable price. I COMPLETELY understand this. My post was meant to educate people about the lesser known topic of anti-female fashion. It was NOT meant to tell you what you should or shouldn’t purchase. ALL women are impacted by patriarchal beauty standards, no matter their body type. In fact, the biggest point I was trying to drive home is that companies like Shein work to promote unreasonable ideal body types. This hurts all women, including plus size women. With that being said, In fashion, it’s a constant difficult choice between sacrificing affordability for ethics and ethics for affordability. Ultimately, it’s your body, so you should clothe yourself however works best for you and your confidence. I just wanted everyone to be aware that this problem exists. 

Lastly, I just want to stress the important of supporting businesses with size inclusivity. Size inclusive businesses promote body positivity and self love. By creating clothing that fits all body types, size inclusive businesses encourage people to embrace their bodies and feel confident in their own skin. This is a significant step towards dismantling unrealistic beauty standards that have long been perpetuated by the fashion industry. The beauty standards are the real devil of the fashion industry ",2023,"All of this is true, and it really sucks that for some, it's all they can afford as even thrift stores have become a grift. This is why I'm learning how to machine sew so I can make my own clothes. It might not be cheap to do sewing projects during a time where inflation is at an all-time high, but it doesn't hurt to try. Trying to be ethical while poor is a process."

Buying from shein cuts out the rich American middle man. It’s putting dollars directly in the hands of the people who would have supplied us the clothing anyway. If we want a moral alternative, it must be American made clothing. 

The children’s place uses Bangladeshi sweat shops for clothes, one time an entire multi floor building collapsed and killed a bunch of women working there and they are still doing great, they are in every mall still to this day. Those women also sell their hair for wigs and live in the same conditions that Chinese workers do (maybe worse, honestly). We just hear about shein because we are deluding ourselves into thinking American clothing exists, and moral clothing exists by buying it through a “reputable” middle man, supporting a whole industry of resellers here, which is the last shred of our once thriving textile industry that fueled the middle class. 

If your politicians cared, they would impose heavy taxes on imported clothing, but they can’t because that’s all there is and they are in the pockets of people who profit off of that. Literally zero companies are moving manufacturing back to America."

I'd argue most people who order from Shein and fast fashion are aware to some degree of many of these issues; they just don't care. 

They have a desired aesthetic, and they will stop at nothing to achieve that desired aesthetic. Women really are our own voyeurs; we love thinking about how great we will look in an article of clothing. We love thinking about the pictures or videos we're going to take when we are in that outfit, what the background will be, how we will pose, what platform we will upload it to, how many people will see us in it, and we cannot wait for other people (especially men!) to see us in that outfit. Half of the fun of going somewhere, of traveling internationally or going somewhere local, is thinking about what we will wear when we are there and how the picture or tiktok or whatever will turn out.

The desire to wear something great and for others to see us in it runs deep, and I don't think we will be able to move beyond fast fashion until we move beyond seeing ourselves as ornaments to display."

A lot of people have been scared by the fact that Temu is stealing and selling data. It’s even scarier when you learn exactly WHAT information they are  stealing and selling…Temu gains FULL access to all of your contacts, calendars, and photo albums, plus all your social media accounts, chats, and texts. In other words, LITERALLY every single thing on your phone, they can and will access. The reason why other websites who collect data don’t go this far is because Temu uses malicious code that allows them to bypass security settings on your phone, read all of your messages and notifications, and change your settings. According to ACTUAL Temu employees who spoke to CNN, the company goes to such lengths in order to “spy on users and competitors in order to boost sales” and that selling the data they collect “is Temu’s largest  source of revenue”. In fact, Temu’s revenue from 2022 consisted of only 11% merchandise sales and a whopping 63% data sales. They’re making a MASSIVE profit off of your data, and barely any profit from sales.

This leads many to believe that Temu only uses it’s cheap prices to lure people in. The real money maker is the data your device brings with you…..ominous…."

Most clothing in my size, regardless of style or fabric,  is incredibly expensive. Even Walmart has started to carry less plus sized clothing in stores. For those on the fatter end of even the plus size spectrum Shein offers what we can't find elsewhere: something to cover our bodies.

fourthwavewomen,FOOD FOR THOUGHT,How Shein and “Fast Fashion” Hurts Women,"So, today I checked out Shein for the first time. A lot of friends were buying from there, and I had to see what the hype was. I instead, discovered an incredibly exploitive, offensive, and cruel company that I want to discuss with you all.

Shein is a “fast fashion” company, which essentially means that they produce poor quality clothes and other products for extremely cheap. (Seriously…$4 for a dress? $1 for a graphic tee?). The thing about fast fashion, is that it relies on EXPLOITING very vulnerable populations, such as women and children. In fact, 80% of garment workers are women. One can find a $5 pair of jeans, and not even realize that the reason the jeans are only $5 is because of the long hours, low wages, and the dangerous labor conditions many women working in this industry are exposed to. The average female garment worker works 16 hours  and only takes home $2 per day. There are many cases where female garment workers and children died at work due to the unsafe conditions. A major example of this is when the Rana Plaza clothing factory in Bangladesh collapsed, and killed over 1,000 workers, many of whom were women.

Fast fashion companies like Shein don’t just harm the workers. It harms the buyers too! They feed on womens’ insecurities and bodies and idealises the fantasies instilled by the patriarchal society into their minds. Fast fashion creates an unsafe space for women and forces them into a cycle of insecurities, body image issues, creates a drive for consumption of trendy clothes to fit into the narrative created for them by the society, and accelerates self-esteem related mental health issues. It promotes a very narrow and unreasonable ideal body type, which teaches young girls and women that they are not enough unless they dress and behave exactly the way they are expected to. The target audience for Shein and similar companies is women ages 18-24. With this in mind, they sell many products tailored towards society’s beauty standards. The sites are riddled with hyper-sexualized clothes. The sites often go as far as to attract buyers to the sexualized and revealing outfits through use of models with photoshopped porn-star bodies. With social media amplifying age-old pressures for teenage girls to conform to certain sexualized narratives, many women feel pressured into purchasing these clothes to “fit in”. 

Overall, Shein is incredibly harmful to women in every aspect. To combat this, some women are deciding to support local businesses as well as ETHICAL clothing brands that actually empower women. Some women are also holding brands accountable for the way they treat their female employees and refuse to buy products from them if they choose to continue the exploitation, miserable long hours, and scanty pay.

The sites are riddled with hyper-sexualized clothes. The sites often go as far as to attract buyers to the sexualized and revealing outfits through use of models with photoshopped porn-star bodies. With social media amplifying age-old pressures for teenage girls to conform to certain sexualized narratives, many women feel pressured into purchasing these clothes to “fit in”. 

Overall, Shein is incredibly harmful to women in every aspect. To combat this, some women are deciding to support local businesses as well as ETHICAL clothing brands that actually empower women. Some women are also holding brands accountable for the way they treat their female employees and refuse to buy products from them if they choose to continue the exploitation, miserable long hours, and scanty pay.

My question for you all is, how do you feel about this? What were your experiences on fast fashion websites like? How else do these companies harm women? I’d love to participate in some dialogue about this lesser known issue!

EDIT: thank you all for the wonderful dialogue about the ethics of fast fashion. I want to address one topic that has repeatedly come up- the fact that many plus size women shop on Shein and other sites like it because it’s their only option to get cute, body inclusive, and comfortable clothes for an affordable price. I COMPLETELY understand this. My post was meant to educate people about the lesser known topic of anti-female fashion. It was NOT meant to tell you what you should or shouldn’t purchase. ALL women are impacted by patriarchal beauty standards, no matter their body type. In fact, the biggest point I was trying to drive home is that companies like Shein work to promote unreasonable ideal body types. This hurts all women, including plus size women. With that being said, In fashion, it’s a constant difficult choice between sacrificing affordability for ethics and ethics for affordability. Ultimately, it’s your body, so you should clothe yourself however works best for you and your confidence. I just wanted everyone to be aware that this problem exists. 

Lastly, I just want to stress the important of supporting businesses with size inclusivity. Size inclusive businesses promote body positivity and self love. By creating clothing that fits all body types, size inclusive businesses encourage people to embrace their bodies and feel confident in their own skin. This is a significant step towards dismantling unrealistic beauty standards that have long been perpetuated by the fashion industry. The beauty standards are the real devil of the fashion industry ",2023,I agree with OP *but* something I will point out is that for fat women fast fashion is often they’re only option for affordable clothing. I wish more women would consider the lack of inclusivity for marginalized bodies when they do their clothes shopping because it’s also unethical to give money to brands and stores that aren’t inclusive.
fourthwavewomen,FOOD FOR THOUGHT,How Shein and “Fast Fashion” Hurts Women,"So, today I checked out Shein for the first time. A lot of friends were buying from there, and I had to see what the hype was. I instead, discovered an incredibly exploitive, offensive, and cruel company that I want to discuss with you all.

Shein is a “fast fashion” company, which essentially means that they produce poor quality clothes and other products for extremely cheap. (Seriously…$4 for a dress? $1 for a graphic tee?). The thing about fast fashion, is that it relies on EXPLOITING very vulnerable populations, such as women and children. In fact, 80% of garment workers are women. One can find a $5 pair of jeans, and not even realize that the reason the jeans are only $5 is because of the long hours, low wages, and the dangerous labor conditions many women working in this industry are exposed to. The average female garment worker works 16 hours  and only takes home $2 per day. There are many cases where female garment workers and children died at work due to the unsafe conditions. A major example of this is when the Rana Plaza clothing factory in Bangladesh collapsed, and killed over 1,000 workers, many of whom were women.

Fast fashion companies like Shein don’t just harm the workers. It harms the buyers too! They feed on womens’ insecurities and bodies and idealises the fantasies instilled by the patriarchal society into their minds. Fast fashion creates an unsafe space for women and forces them into a cycle of insecurities, body image issues, creates a drive for consumption of trendy clothes to fit into the narrative created for them by the society, and accelerates self-esteem related mental health issues. It promotes a very narrow and unreasonable ideal body type, which teaches young girls and women that they are not enough unless they dress and behave exactly the way they are expected to. The target audience for Shein and similar companies is women ages 18-24. With this in mind, they sell many products tailored towards society’s beauty standards. The sites are riddled with hyper-sexualized clothes. The sites often go as far as to attract buyers to the sexualized and revealing outfits through use of models with photoshopped porn-star bodies.

Brands like Sézane, Arket, & Other Stories, use a lot of high quality materials in their clothes (wool, merino, cashmere, cotton, silk etc) so they last longer and feel more luxurious. But they're not really produced ethically (Arket and & Other Stories for example are part of the H&M group) so that's why I like to buy them second hand. Bonus is that if you do get bored with an item after a while, you can easily resell them on Vinted again, because the quality remains good. 

Do note that some of their clothes are still made from bad materials like polyester, so it's always worth it to check the material with the seller before you buy. 

Vinted also has an option to filter on material these days. So if you're looking for a cashmere jumper for example, you can easily sort on that. Good way to get high quality items for a lower price."

The following submission statement was provided by /u/Vucea:

The sustainable textiles strategy, due to be unveiled on Wednesday, will target clothes at every stage of use, including design, repair and recycling.

The initiative aims to boost the market for sustainably made garments.

Manufacturers will have to ensure their clothes are eco-friendly and hard-wearing.

And consumers will be given more information on how to reuse, repair and recycle their clothes.

Ioana Popescu of environmental NGO, the Environmental Coalition on Standards, said the rules to be announced by the European Commission are designed to bring in longer-lasting products that can be used multiple times rather than worn a few times then thrown away.

Similar rules will apply to the likes of electronics, such as smartphones, and furniture under an initiative known as the Sustainable Products Initiative (SPI), she added.

It's estimated that less than 1% of all clothing worldwide is recycled.

malefashionadvice,Video,The Ugly Truth Of Fast Fashion,,2019,"Just watched this the other night. I gotta say it's incredible how many clothes people buy and I think his point about social media influencing the need to buy new clothing is very on point. 

That said, I think a lot of the style that MFA tends to advocate for (in the most general sense) is stuff that is fairly timeless and nondescript but looks good when layered and combined with other pieces. This is the whole principle of the ""Basic Bastard"" look that is so popular. It's a clothing style that will last you years, and you won't feel any need to throw something out because it's not trendy enough, for example.

Fashion can have different meanings. In this video, they use fashion to describe popular trends over a short period of time and the manufacturing cycles for these clothing trends that produce a ton of waste. In the case of this subreddit, I'd say it usually means more like how to look generally good and presentable.

malefashionadvice,Video,The Ugly Truth Of Fast Fashion,,2019,"Lady here. Just watched the ep and I'm torn. Coming from an immigrant family, you wear your shirts/pants until they've been sewn over 10 times and then as a once broke college student working 3 jobs, I had to shop at places like Forever 21 and H&M. I couldn't even afford Zara...

Though rare, there are high-quality items in these stores. I have a suit jacket from H&M that has been a lucky charm at job interviews since my college days (almost 10 years ago) and faux leather boots from Forever 21 that I got 5 years ago that are still waterproof (seasonally worn). 

But I don't agree with how these fast fashion companies are churning out styles and being wasteful. IMO the blame doesn't fall entirely on the companies though. I would argue that the blame is more on wasteful consumers, as it's in the culture to just throw things away, at least in the U.S. 

Nowadays, I buy ~10 pieces/year from inexpensive to pricey brands. How on earth are people are buying 80 pieces/year?! My parents keep only 5 articles of each type of apparel (5 work shirts, 5 regular tops, 5 skirts, 5 dresses, 5 pants, etc.), and they wear them until they are shredded.

Maybe if this kind of mentality was more prevalent, there would be less of an environmental problem from fashion! Also, check out Poshmark. There are some great unloved items on there, and it helps keep my closet the same size. Sell 1 thing, buy 1 thing. Rinse, repeat."

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I have been hanging out (and especially buying) less and less from this subreddit. My reasons are a bit more unique.

Until recently, I worked at Forever 21 corporate. Coincidentally, as I started to work there, I became more concerned and aware of fast fashion's impact on the environment. I also saw it around me with the amount of cardboard, plastic and cheap clothing that was thrown out and roaming in the hallways every day. There wasn't a day that went by I didn't pick up a blouse, cardboard, plastic or tags from all over the place. It is so wasteful.

One weekend, we had a Warehouse sale. They converted the parking lot into a giant clothing graveyard that was littered with clothes, cardboard, and plastic. I did not attend the event however, the horror hit me Monday morning.

I got to work and walked through the parking lot and was shook by the scene in front of me. There was trash EVERYWHERE! the ground, the trees, stuck to the fence. People went through and decimated the boxes and contents. Clothes that were trampled in the rush. Left grimy on the floor covered in footprints and tangled in bits of plastic. These trash piles were taller than me. The wind was depositing the filth on the already filthy downtown Los Angeles streets as the cleanup crew showed little regard for the loose garbage as it flew away.

I left that job and decided to break the personal cycle. I went through my closet and removed items that did not fit or I did not wear. Many of these items were FMF pickups. Things that everyone else was clamoring over so I scooped them up before they sold out. Shirts that never fit, did not go with anything else I owned or things I regrettably bought on impulse, did not work and was too lazy to return. These items were donated to charity (except for my beat-up Killshots, those had to go to the trash).

I am fortunate enough to have lost enough weight to go down two sizes in my shirt this year (XL to Medium). As I was at Target with my basket full of the shirts I ""liked"" in half a dozen colors, I paused and thought to myself ""I can do better"". I left the shirts behind and came home in search of better. I learned what colors work for me and how to use them. I also learned about fit and what truly looks good on me. I went in person to check out a made in the USA boutique. The shirts were double what I would normally pay ($15-$32) yet they fit me like a dream, are made of much better materials and I had a salesperson to support me with color choices, fit and styling ideas.

I do not need 15-20 shirts. I now have 6 solid colors that I use to build on. They are more comfortable, better fitting, more distinctive colors and I am way more confident in them. I took an afternoon, did research, asked questions and now my fashion game has stepped up so much. I now see the value in buying one great fitting pair of jeans as opposed to three randos I got at a Uniqlo sale. Do your homework, it will pay off for you and the planet.

If you need to hear it today, you do not need those items from Gap, JCrew, Uniqlo or Xmas timbs. Trust me. I almost got the astronaut slippers too. You can resist and do better."

lululemon,Discussion,prove me wrong: lululemon is no longer luxury and is now fast fashion,"i love analyzing trends, & after seeing the articles about lululemons stock decrease due to sitting on a \~billion dollars worth of inventory, this made me curious to check inventory + launches + pricing model.

so, theres about 118 (give or take) new womens items every week that launch every tuesday, and during the holiday season we even saw double this due to the holiday rush.

on wmtm currently theres 725 items for women. ive seen upwards to 1,000 before...

so my questions are: when in the history of ever have we seen almost \~8 new scuba colors every single week (including FZ HZ & funnel HZ) for almost 3 months straight? 725 SKUS on sale? outlets BRIMMING with inventory they cant turn over? does anyone else remember when lulu was considered luxury/just at the point where it was almost unattainable because of SCARCITY/getting a piece from lulu was a treat rather than the norm? and now the fabric is just....meh or getting worse for 90% of the items?

*is this a case of growth/growing pains or a case of fast fashion?*

im convinced this is lululemons new pricing model & strategy.

* full price drops = insane markup. they dont even intend to sell out at this price, but tiktok drives revenue. notice the only things that sell out, are going viral on TT. almost 95% of this inventory ends up on WMTM
* WMTM = the old full price, but everyone thinks its on sale, so they buy anyways. still extremely marked up and not worth this price. problem is the quality is literally comparable to amazon brands like CRZ butterluxe, im genuinely curious if its even worth this price..
* outlets = the real sale price, aka the old sale price. still overpriced but more in line to what the item is actually worth since the quality has decreased so much.

again, my point with my post is for discussion only. my entire closet is lulu so this isnt me shitting on the brand, im still obsessed (i know whats of quality vs whats not). but i have noticed after boxing day my fomo is at an all time low with these latest drops, as i realize the quality of most items isnt worth the price + i genuinely cant keep up with the inventory because there is too much 😂 and this just made me ponder how lulu was never like this. i wonder is this change is because of tiktok and the rise of fashion nova / whitefox type brands, and i also wonder internally if this strategy is actually going to work long term, or if were going to see lululemon in tj maxx soon. lol

I’m gonna sound like the elder millennial I am, but I agree with your assessment that tiktok influences it. I also happen to be a high school teacher. It used to be that people that shopped at Lulu were yogis or runners, the end. As a yogi, I knew people who worked there from local studios, they ran special classes on weekends, there was community outreach, etc. Sometimes you’d walk into a store and an educator would just hand you a coupon for that day. That was what we went to for fancy yoga wear, but all these same people would also not turn their nose down at someone in class just because they were in target leggings. Now it feels very teenager-trend forward, and I don’t think anyone even feels the need to workout in their lululemon. Like you, I’m not really criticizing the brand or their shoppers. I love scubas and ebbs too. But it definitely isn’t as special as it once was because of the market they’re currently targeting.

will lululemon win without the scarcity model in the coming years? i love to hear your take!",2023,"I love this post! I’m an ecomm strategist for a global outdoor brand and also a fitness lover and former lulu fanatic.

From my POV as a customer, it’s been sad to see the decline of the following:
- lululemon’s design department: they’re not coming out with anything that’s new design-wise. There’s money in scubas and aligns so they’re just cranking those out as fast as they can. To your point, this is fast fashion at work because in order to facilitate the volume and turnaround on just these items, they need to seek lower quality, more factories (which means less consistency). 

2. Setting themselves up for failure - maybe this is an overreach but so much of WMTM is core styles in colors people weren’t interested in. Their strategy of colorize the few main stays in their line because of TikTok demand is short sighted and as their quality continues to decline and more and more people like you and I lose patience with the brand, they’re going to lose their core customer in favor of trend chasers.

3. An identity crisis - I see some commentary arguing lulu isn’t “luxury” - a reminder that luxury is a relative term we use in the fashion industry based on average price point. The average price point a female customer with a middle of the road income feels comfortable paying for workout leggings was in the mid-$50s in 2022. That means the tag of luxury assuming we average a pair of lulu leggings at $108 represents customers spending double the average expenditure making it high end luxury. 

There are so many women on this sub who buy their staples and look forward to new colors in their staples - they can justify it. IMO right now it seems they’re riding the gen z tiktok trend and losing the trust of their core customer and as I said above - they directly conflict creating an identity crisis.

I personally miss some cooler designs they’d do - unique seams, color blocking, and clothing that was black but found unique cuts and styles to elevate. I also miss work-adjacent clothes that were athleisure but appropo for a casual workplace. 

I’ve found a decent love for Athleta, though I don’t love their leggings as much as I loved my lux wunder unders or much older aligns!"

Agree the quality has declined. I have leggings that are 12 yrs old that still look great. My newer LLL is not as well made but still much better than Nike, Sweaty Betty or Zella, so I still buy 🤷🏻‍♀️"

Post-pandemic LL that’s peddled on TT feels so different. Even this sub is so different than it was 3 years ago. I think the bastardization of the brand has to do with this demographic shift.

The fact that they try to sell them for even more now is likely why their stock is going down. An example being the align leggings with pockets being priced so high. Like all aligns, they last a few wears max before they start to pill. Lululemon clothing is too over valued for the crap that it is. Just my opinion."

will lululemon win without the scarcity model in the coming years? i love to hear your take!",2023,"I was just talking to my sister today about how tiktok trends are seeming to accelerate trends quicker than they used to and how more people seem to get hooked on trends. Like she was talking about booktok and the way people are collectively latching into really terrible books because they blow up on TT. Like I know book clubs and blogs have been a thing but the reach on TT is far wider and with social media things cycle way quicker. I especially worry about the impact on kids; I saw a young girl in lulu over Christmas begging her dad for hotty hots and swiftlys because “it’s what I saw on tiktok and it has to be this outfit!”. The influence and the reach is definitely not something I’ve seen before and brands are really taking trends and running with them. 

Brands that adapt will definitely see an increase in product as they try to predict what will be trending. I think lulu has always tried to be versatile and as their audience shifts they will as well, but I think as they’ve become more popular they’ve just tried to reach a wider audience, thus having more styles and colours."

Because fabrics and designs at the same quality get easily copied these days. Alo is positioning themselves as luxury yoga active wear, (and I have a couple of items from them) but the colors are boring, designs are so-so, and quality isn't worth the price.

For a pair of basic black leggings, I like mine from Aritzia the most out of Lulu, Alo, Everlane, GC. But only Lulu colors are exciting for me. None of the other brands are as large as Lulu to release as many colors and SKUs."

so my questions are: when in the history of ever have we seen almost \~8 new scuba colors every single week (including FZ HZ & funnel HZ) for almost 3 months straight? 725 SKUS on sale? outlets BRIMMING with inventory they cant turn over? does anyone else remember when lulu was considered luxury/just at the point where it was almost unattainable because of SCARCITY/getting a piece from lulu was a treat rather than the norm? and now the fabric is just....meh or getting worse for 90% of the items?

*is this a case of growth/growing pains or a case of fast fashion?*

im convinced this is lululemons new pricing model & strategy.

* full price drops = insane markup. they dont even intend to sell out at this price, but tiktok drives revenue. notice the only things that sell out, are going viral on TT. almost 95% of this inventory ends up on WMTM
* WMTM = the old full price, but everyone thinks its on sale, so they buy anyways. still extremely marked up and not worth this price. problem is the quality is literally comparable to amazon brands like CRZ butterluxe, im genuinely curious if its even worth this price..
* outlets = the real sale price, aka the old sale price. still overpriced but more in line to what the item is actually worth since the quality has decreased so much.

again, my point with my post is for discussion only. my entire closet is lulu so this isnt me shitting on the brand, im still obsessed (i know whats of quality vs whats not). but i have noticed after boxing day my fomo is at an all time low with these latest drops, as i realize the quality of most items isnt worth the price + i genuinely cant keep up with the inventory because there is too much 😂 and this just made me ponder how lulu was never like this. i wonder is this change is because of tiktok and the rise of fashion nova / whitefox type brands, and i also wonder internally if this strategy is actually going to work long term, or if were going to see lululemon in tj maxx soon. lol

And they used to have color “themes” (for lack of a better term) each month-ish. So, they’d release a bit at a time throughout the month, but all of the special colors coordinated. And there were fewer special colors. While I do appreciate that they’ve branched out with offering more color options, I feel like they’ve gone too far the opposite way. 

It used to be a more cohesive collection. Now, it’s just all the things in a bunch of colors. 

And I definitely feel they’ve moved away from innovation and from truly special prints."

will lululemon win without the scarcity model in the coming years? i love to hear your take!",2023,"I am wondering if the shift in LLL’s business model has anything to do with their global expansion during the last couple years. LLL has pushed hard in China’s market. They make the “Asian fit” versions of many items just for these markets. The prices are ridiculously high in China (at least 50% higher than North American prices) but their popularity is still growing in that huge market. It’s definitely “luxury” there and I’ve seen people referring LLL as the “Hermes of athletic wear”(which is almost laughable). No doubt they are making a LOT of money on the other side of the globe.
I think LLL’s fast expansion definitely switches their focus from quality to quantity, which emphasizes marketing over anything. So we can see a lot of frequent drops, social media promotions and price hikes/deep markdowns. The expansion also makes them focus more on where the new and hot revenue comes and make the already semi-saturated North American markets less a priority, which can probably explains the decline in quality, service, designs, etc. 
P.S., I have a couple of the “Asian fit” items and somehow they feel more of quality to me. I don’t own enough of them to make a proper comparison tho."

Examples: juicy couture, Abercrombie, Hollister, Aeropostale (just what I can think of right now). Those were the trendy brands back in the day that everyone wanted to buy to be cool. Where are those brands now? Yea, A&F is still around, but it doesn’t have the cool factor. Juicy couture is just a tiny bit trendy rn due to the y2k trend, but its still not where it was at. Right now it’s lulu’s it girl era, but yea some day it might be a TJ Maxx brand or brand that’s constantly running sales 🤷🏽‍♀️ I think brands are aware of that and ride the waves.

Also, it is still in the same price range as other performance activewear like north face, patagonia, Nike, etc. It’s not really luxury."

I was raised to favor second hand over new, and when I was a teenager I was ridiculed for thrifting. It was considered dirty and something only poor, desperate people do. Now it's trendy and people admire you for it in most circles, and a lot more people feel free to do it. This is a very positive change in attitude IMO and hopefully this attitude will keep improving and changing toward more sustainability and frugal habits."

I have clothing items ive kept for yeaaaars and they are still “in fashion” we are at a point in fashion history where there isnt only one specific trend circulation right now anyways. We are basically in an anything goes stage. Instead of buying 3 fast fashion tops , buy one slow fashion top.

The quality and material are terrible, and the clothing is so cheap to buy new, nobody wants it used, especially because it doesn’t wear well. 

My theory, which I want to be wrong, is in 10 years, there aren’t going to be a lot of clothes to thrift from or thrifting will be an exclusive experience of second hand luxury goods—that wont serve the ppl who need it."

Consumerism and capitalism promote quick turnaround of production. 

Everything that is purchased routinely and often, instead of a one time durable purchase that lasts years, is fast fashion.

I haven’t bought a single ‘fast fashion’ or brand new item of clothing in about 7 years because with depop, eBay, charity shops, thrifting, I can find better and more unique clothing at a fraction of the price *and* get much more enjoyment out of finding outfits and developing my style by searching and digging. We all know the key to an amazing outfit is looking at least 15% homeless so buying second hand is the true key to perfecting your fits. 

My only loophole is band merch, which is usually made via ‘fast’ means but if you’re supporting a worthy cause you should draw the ethical line yourself. If everybody stopped buying half as much cheap shit off bad corp retailers the world would be greener and people would be happier."

I run a garments factory in India. Employ more than 1200 people. They have social security, paid more than minimum wages, annual increments, state sponsored health care facility, subsidized food, free lunch in the factory on working days, no income taxes (of course), specific job roles and a hierarchy to climb up and become supervisors/managers. 

There are also so many factories that it’s the owners who have a tough time retaining workers as they move even for a 5% bump. Working conditions are approved by ISO and even multiple brand audits. In fact, some workers tell me that they enjoy being in the factory than in their own homes.

It’s funny and rather ignorant of people to assume that every factory runs like those in China. The workers in India specially, have major political backing. If even one of them is mistreated or fired for no reason whatsoever, be sure to have your factory in lockdown for a week, minimum."

No hate to those that use them. It is its own skill as well. Just the whole idea of either being fast fashion is ridiculous.



Fast fashion isn't about how fast individual clothes can be made. It's about how fast it goes from design to in-store. ""Slow fashion"" is more the 4 seasons of fashion style in a year since it took months from design to store. Fast fashion is a combination of less time from design to store and less time between new clothing styles in store. The purpose is to make people come back more often so they don't ""miss out."" A lot of fast and slow fashion is made by the same manufacturers. 

The key point of fast fashion is overconsumption. 
As for sweatshops they can be for slow fashion as well. Fast fashion can have be ethically made and bought as well. 

(A lot of people here tend to be from the USA. Just remember the USA isn't sweatshops free. Lots of nuance to this.)"

Anytime you see crochet in stores you know some poor person is making pennies for the hours of work they put in.

While all fast fashion sucks you can assume most if not all knitting seen in stores is done on machines so while still shitty I hope it's not as terrible a comparison.

I'll buy a store knitted sweater but I refuse to buy crochet unless it's from a handmade shop or thrifted.

Yeah crochet may be faster if you used longer stitches like double crochet but you could say the same for fingering weight yarn vs worsted or bulky.

I do both and find they both have great characteristics it just depends on what I'm looking for.

Crochet lace is way easier but also way more intricate. And the fabric is usually easily reversible vs knitting lace is sooooo hard ( at least to me, some people love it) and if it's stockinette you're going to have distinct differences to each side.

Crochet can also make some beautiful structured pieces and I think most people would say crochet amigurumi is way easier than knitting. Crocheting in the round is much easier and only requires one tool.

Knitting however is usually much stretchier than crochet and the fabric typically has better drape. You can still do lace or amigurumi but it's typically hard to work on the round. Knitting requires double points and possibly circulars unless it's seamed and dpns can be tricky AF to learn.

I wish there wasn't some bs entitlement to some people and we could all just get along as yarn / fiber artists."

Fast fashion is not ""item of clothing made quickly"" it specifically describes fashion quickly mass produced by corporations, often using extremely cheap labor, to be bought by people, worn a couple times, then thrown away. By definition no handmade item made for personal use or handmade by a seller can be ""fast fashion"" no matter how much you don't like the item or whatever, because labor exploitation and mass production are key parts of fast fashion.

Anyway they were obviously just being a snob and looking down on others while misusing a term with a specific meaning"

Thanks in advance!",2023,"Learning how to find QUALITY clothes at the thrift store takes skill and is 100% worth it for your wallet. It’s easy to thrift crap that will fall apart on you after a few wears. Having go-to brands is nice, but as you mentioned with the Levi’s, not always fool-proof. A few years ago, I spent time watching YouTube and reading articles on what makes a piece of clothing high-quality. Primarily, it comes down to FABRIC and STITCHING. Always check fabric tags to ensure you’re buying durable fabrics and not cheap blends that will fall apart (for jeans, I always look for 100% cotton, and for shirts/sweaters i look for 100% wool, cotton, linen, or cashmere). I wouldn’t be surprised if the Levi’s you bought had elastic in them. Also, the stitching on a garment can tell you a lot about how long it will last, so I recommend looking into that as well. Best of luck on your frugal clothing search!"

Thanks in advance!",2023,"A couple of observations from a lifelong thrifter and used clothes buyer who worked in trades.

Be selective about the textiles and weaves of  your work clothes. Synthetics such as nylon and polyester (and their blends) as well as weaves such as [ripstop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripstop) are **much** tougher and more durable than 100% cotton (denim) clothes. Accordingly, I used to wear cheap nylon shells/vests/overalls over top my T- or under-shirts as they'd take the brunt of the abuse.

Though thick, heavy jeans are commonly regarded as synonymous with durable work wear, they shouldn't be. The fibres they're constructed from ultimately have the last word and anyway you slice it [cotton is not a strong fibre](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/assets/education/making-stuff/stuff-toolkit-stronger-demo.pdf) (see chart page 4). That's why it's often fortified with nylon or polyester in blends and different weaves. Love your Levis if you will but all-cotton denim is a 150 year old technology and we've come a long way since then.

Cast a wider net. Trawl online buy and sell or recycling forums, eg., [freecycle.org](https://freecycle.org), FB Marketplace, Kijiji,etc, for lot bargains. Ditto Army Surplus stores. Don't be timid to post ""Wanted"" ads there.

Good luck."

Frugal,Advice Needed ✋,How do you avoid fast fashion/poor quality clothes?,"I'm not big on shopping and I've gotten by for most of my life on hand-me-downs and thrift stores. But with inflation, even the thrift stores near me are priced about the same as buying new. And when I buy new to try for something that lasts, it doesn't. (Maybe I'm just pissed because the new Levi's I just bought ripped after like a month)

I am admittedly hard on my clothes - I have an active job and farm in my spare time - so I don't want designer clothes. I just want a sturdy wardrobe that I don't have to replace every month.

So if thrift stores are too expensive and buying new doesn't guarantee quality, I feel a bit muddled. Any suggestions on things to look for when I'm shopping to find clothes that will last?

Thanks in advance!",2023,">But with inflation, even the thrift stores near me are priced about the same as buying new

It's not because of inflation. It's because of resellers. Thrift stores with mostly younger customers and/or middle class (or higher) are priced higher because its ""trendy"" and so many people have been buying used clothes to sell online for upwards of 5x the price of what they bought it for at the thrift store. Stores with mostly older and/or low income are still more or less the same price range. There's a place near me that sells clothes for less than $1 still"

I fucking hated it at first, especially since my school had a lot of rich kids in designer clothes and carrying their books in Chanel bags. Then I found a pair of designer jeans for $5 and kind of started to get the appeal.


Then I got to college and wanted to totally revamp my wardrobe. But I was broke (and saving my money for weed lol) so I truly started embracing thrifting, and having clothing swaps with friends. Some of my favorite and most interesting pieces that I still wear today (or remember fondly) were from thrifting, or gifted by friends.


Now I’m almost 30 and have more than enough money to buy new clothes. Which I did for a year or two before I realized how little joy it brought me.


I’m back to thrifting/consignment shops and nothing compares to finding something really cool, and then it fits. I can walk out with like 8-10 new items and have spent less than $100. Then every few months sell my unwanted clothes to a consignment shop, and put the credit towards a refreshed wardrobe.


It’s really just the way to go. I’ll never be wealthy/stylish enough to keep up with current trends anyway. 😅"

These fashion houses give executive’s bonuses and pay rises, in the place of paying workers a realistic wage which would allow them to buy quality clothes. They pay them little, and then claiming they need to make cheap trash clothes so poor, low wage people still look good. But now it’s gone further,  they move production offshore to poor countries to exploit lax labour laws, so they pay even less and so 12 year olds, likely forced to work by their families, miss out on a childhood and an education, for the sake off a few men having a standard of living these children could never aspire to.

That’s without going into the criminal disregard for C02 production and other wastes of the world resources, along with how much of these cloth items end up in dumps, or sent to poor African countries who are now drowning in disposed fast fashion.

 I’m speechless. The more I read about this, the more shocked it makes me. This is ugly as hell.

It’s obviously in the benefit of these fashion houses to keep the labour force poor in order for there to be a market for their product. It’s a tinderbox situation, all things considered."

[00:18:38],,2021,"Literally every industry on earth is either already based on this model or is heading in that direction. The problem is that capitalism functions by incentivizing maximal profit and minimal costs to produce never-ending growth. Capitalist production literally can't not eventually squeeze the last drop of life out of this earth we call home. This will not be solved by buying different things. The solution cannot come from within the system. All you do by changing your consumer choices is shuffle around where capital accumulates and multiplies. This has to be addressed on the production side of the equation. Production must cease.

What is needed is a systemic takeover of the economic system, and a conscious, democratic re-orientation of global production to meet human needs, and sustain life on earth. This is impossible without mass social power. Power needs to be seized, and wrested from the hands of the current owners. If you're an individual the best thing you can do is join a mass organization in your country that aims to eventually transform the economic system to one that is pro-human instead of pro-capital growth.

As one of the other posters here pointed out even here on the other side of the Atlantic I know which stores I'd avoid.

There has been a [recent survey](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/07/uk-among-most-liberal-countries-on-divorce-and-abortion-survey-reveals) on attitudes worldwide and it has shown that in the UK we are leaning towards a more liberal stance.  I was listening to a report on this on the radio, whilst I made dinner this evening.  One of the things that they talked about is how our attitudes change as we get older.  We've all seen it with parents and elderly relatives. How the fire of youth burns out to the resignation of old age.

This got me thinking about how my views and attitudes have changed over the years.

In my 20s organic food was just starting to take off.  I would look at it with almost lust knowing in my heart that I should be buying it but knowing that I just couldn't afford it.  When you are living on tinned tomatoes and pasta, just being able to buy some cheese was a luxury.

We've put all my craft things in storage, in preparation for moving.  Luckily I've catalogued my stash so I've been able to plan what projects I want to do next.  I was looking at my yarn stash inventory and it struck me that one of the issues I've had with buying from indie dyers is that whilst their methods may be great, very few of them can prove that the yarn they are dying is ethically sourced.

Whilst I have standard acrylic yarn from large independent UK yarn manufacturers which has a more traceable and sustainable source.  Its interesting to read how they have made a conscious decision to develop acrylic yarns that have less shedding in the wash so that it reduces micro plastics in water.

I started to become more interested in the sustainability and sources of the things I use for my crafts after a friend was trying to get a CE mark for the toys she made and was having issues getting fact sheets for the yarns she was using. It was interesting to see just what information manufacturers held on their products and how helpful they were to other people.

What I discovered was that it is possible to access good products from good people but you do have to put a little work in to find them.  But, as I said at the start of my ramble, in a world where we have access to the internet, it still gets me that people who post on the internet can be totally oblivious to the background of the things they are purchasing and the people they are purchasing from."

That being said I think the bigger issue is spending luxurious amounts of money on yarn and thinking it’s “sustainable” just because it has wool or natural content; when for the same amount of money and a little bit of research on where the material comes from you could be making a better choice.
My point is, even a lot of the “good stuff” is just well marketed “bad stuff”."

Does it give you YouTube bragging rights?

And is that better than buying some yarn from Hobbii that you have an immediate plan for and knitting and wearing said yarn?  Should you slink away in shame because you bought from Hobbii?

I try not to over consume and I try not to be wasteful. And I worry about my own choices, not other people's.

Nonetheless I would engage in serious conversation about these issues if people werent such hyypocrits.  Like all that mental energy spent dissing everyone fashion and yarn choices whilst enjoying all their Chinese electronics.

Jesus Christ if being on trend and looking nice for Instagram is more important than having a livable environment and/or doing your bit to preempt human slavery just be honest and say that."

malefashionadvice,Article,Is it Classist to be Against Fast Fashion? -Put This On,,2022,"The two big problems I see with the thrift argument are:

1. Poor people don’t have time to rake through thrift stores looking for clothes. You wouldn’t believe how time poor being cash poor makes you. 

2. There simply isn’t enough clothes available at thrift stores to maintain everyone (in the situation where you could click your fingers and have everyone move from fast fashion to thrift). 

There’s a nasty feedback loop between these points too. If more people thrift, then others need to spend more time looking for clothes through ever decreasing product availability. This isn’t something you can do when you’re time poor"

By poor as shit, I mean my family lived on about 2/3 of the mean income in Australia with 4 kids and then when I moved out I was earning award rate while living in horrible share houses.

Even when I was broke as fuck, we either had decent clothes but not many of them, or mum made our clothes (useful because I picked up sewing). I could buy 5 pairs of cheap jeans from the local department store for the same cost as a set of Levi's, but the Levi's will last me 5x as long as an individual pair and I'll be more willing to fix them if they break. I bought a Helly Hansen rain jacket and a north face windbreaker both over 7 years ago, and they're still going strong where my cheap ones died after a season.

malefashionadvice,Article,Is it Classist to be Against Fast Fashion? -Put This On,,2022,"As someone who has recently tried to overhaul his wardrobe, it may be.

I make ok money, but families are expensive. So I usually go to H&M (which I now have to drive 45 minutes to) because it is affordable usually. But the last time I went it was all what I can “coke dealer chic” shirts. Not at all my jam.

So I started looking around at other places and I found 3 situations.

1) It looks good but is WAY too expensive. I just can’t bring myself to spend $90 on a shirt. And some blogs are so oblivious to what “affordable” means. https://putthison.com/how-to-shop-on-a-budget/

2) It is not local, so I can’t try it on. I’m tall, but not big, with very long limbs. Most clothing that isn’t measured (like 34/34 jeans) doesn’t fit me properly. So I end up wasting a bunch of money.

3) I hate the style. I hear all the time “Just do {insert fashion thing here}. Learn to wear jewelry. Just layer stuff. Embrace the trends.” I haven’t spent my life making fashion a hobby and I just don’t understand how to do a lot of these things or I don’t like how it looks. 

But I’m being bombarded with indirect criticism on how men that dress in jeans and a t-shirt are just lazy. I literally don’t know what to do."
malefashionadvice,Article,Is it Classist to be Against Fast Fashion? -Put This On,,2022,"Honestly, I'm not even against fast fashion.

&#x200B;

""Buy expensive brands so it lasts longer"" is kind of a cope. You just want to justify spending a lot of money on clothes.

&#x200B;

I've bought a lot of clothes over the years, from very expensive, higher end brands, to lower end mall brands, to pretty cheap fast fashion. In men's clothing, fast fashion brands don't really last shorter than the nicer brands. Outside of perhaps the really bottom tier (think shit like, $5 jeans),even the low tier fast fashion brands are fine.

&#x200B;

No seriously, I've purchased crap like Zara jeans and Calvin Klein dress shirts. This shit is fine, that Calvin Klein dress shirt I got for like, $20 at the outlet? Its fine, lasted me years. No shorter than say, Brooks Brothers.

&#x200B;

The mythical ""I went to Zara to buy a shirt and it fell apart in 2 washes"" is a serious boogeyman.

&#x200B;

PS: Using ""shein hauls"" as a talking point is literally a moral panic. It reminds me of the ""heavy metal turned my son satanist"" talking point. 

&#x200B;

The world has 4 billion men. I'm sure you can find like, 3 dudes with a giant shein haul on social media, but that is in no way representative of the way the average man shops for clothes.

&#x200B;

Its like how, of the millions of heavy metal fans in the world, I'm sure you can dig up a few dudes that became satanists after becoming metal fans, but that is in no way representative. 

&#x200B;

Similarly, think about the every man, the average dude. When presented with a cheaper clothing option, they take it and wear it like every other piece of clothing. Why? They don't give a damn about fashion. They aren't thinking ""wow, I budgeted \[insert huge sum\] for clothes this month, now that I can find cheaper clothes, I'll buy more!"""
malefashionadvice,Article,Is it Classist to be Against Fast Fashion? -Put This On,,2022,"It's all perspective. If you're constantly having to buy cheap clothes because those very cheap clothes you buy only last 3 washes, you might as well have gone ahead and invested in a few more expensive items that would have lasted you *years*. You're not saving money if you're buying cheap-but-often compared to expensive-but-occasional. 

Not to say you have to go out and spend thousands or even hundreds on everything if that's not your budget but you can at least try *mid-range* (and/or look for bargains during sale season), and like other comments said vintage and pre-loved is also a thing. You could even get old clothes you really love mended by a tailor if they're salvageable.

That's all before we even get onto the environmental impact of wasteful fast fashion."

Fast fashion or not. Let’s face it, it’s unlikely that most of us who are anti fast fashion would stick to our principles if offered the opportunities islanders are presented with.

From a review of the tone of comments on various posts regarding islander fast fashion deals, the difference in sentiment is stark. It has to be said - does this sub and the wider internet not notice and acknowledge its own double standards and hypocrisy?

Boohoo Man is the same umbrella company as PLT. Oh Polly is a fast fashion company too. Yet consider the reception of Gemma’s deal compared to that of Davide, Ekin and Indiyah’s. Ekin, Davide and Indiyah’s deals are celebrated and spoken of overwhelmingly positively, yet Gemma had Greenpeace making a public statement criticising her choices and calling her the queen of toxic plastic pollution, and countless negative comments and tweets due to it being a fast fashion deal (leaving aside the fair and warranted criticism of PLT’s use of Indiyah). 99% of the commentary surrounding Gemma’s PLT deal was negative. 99% of the commentary surrounding the other deals is positive.

Having worked in fashion for years I know that anything sustainable from those companies are simply greenwashing. The amount abs price of what they make actually makes it impossible to be remotely sustainable. 

Buying from these companies is a net negative for our world, but realistically it’s up to governments to create anti dumping regulations and tariffs to discourage overproduction. 

I want to repeat that NONE of these partnerships will be sustainable. Acting like they will encourage sustainability of use sustainable fabrics is a marketing lie."

I’m sure I’m guilty of it but fast fashion deals are not where I’ll be defending anyone, even my favs.


I think it’s fair to say that islanders coming off the show are going to be influenced by money and truthfully, though ethical and sustainable fashion is getting more attention these days, it’s hardly mainstream. Yeah I wish ppl coming off LI wouldn’t actively profit from and prop up some of the worst offenders in fast fashion, but I also realize it’s unrealistic to expect people who go on reality tv show to be paragons of virtue and environmental & human rights activists (even if I would love that lol). 


But truthfully I’ve actually been pleasantly surprised by how much conversation there is these days about fast fashion vs ethical/sustainable fashion bc as someone who has been trying to be more ethical in my fashion choices for years, it never seemed like the average person I interacted with cared very much. So despite the stan wars that seem to be incited this year, I’m encouraged by the fact it’s even being discussed this much. We’ve got a long way to go but it seems like there is a growing shift in demand.


The other thing is the influencer industry isn’t designed to be particularly ethical or sustainable so there aren’t the same kind of partnerships available. Capitalism is wasteful and exploitative 🤷🏼‍♀️ 


Climate change was exacerbated by the fashion industry and it’s also going to be why the industry dies—it’s not going to be profitable anymore very soon and we’re all going to have to get used to paying much more for clothing sooner than later anyway."

In fact, it just makes the mass outrage towards Gemma appear wholly ingenuine, and suggests that Gemma was criticised so deeply because of who she is, rather than for her actions.

ETA: This is NOT a defence of fast fashion. In an ideal world, all islanders would spurn the idea of such a deal. Criticism for taking a fast fashion deal is absolutely warranted. The point I am making is that the online discourse is hypocritical because the fact that certain islanders took fast fashion deals has been totally glossed over, whereas another was widely condemned.",2022,"Interesting point. I think there are other elements at play here - Gemma Owen is from a wealthy and privileged background so to some extent might be held to a higher standard than the others because she doesn’t financially need these deals. She may also be - rightly or wrongly - viewed as less deserving than others because of this. 

And for a lil insider tip, sometimes brands like Greenpeace will whack out a statement to ride on a wave. You can’t trust Greenpeace, just ask Cousin Greg."
LoveIslandTV,UNPOPULAR OPINION ALERT,Fast Fashion & Double Standards 🦄,"I made a comment to this effect on a recent post, but on reflection feel it deserves it’s own post. 

I held my tongue on all islander fast fashion announcements thus far, because I am honestly happy for all islanders who secure deals after the show because they entertained us all summer and deserve to reap some rewards. Fast fashion or not. Let’s face it, it’s unlikely that most of us who are anti fast fashion would stick to our principles if offered the opportunities islanders are presented with.

From a review of the tone of comments on various posts regarding islander fast fashion deals, the difference in sentiment is stark. It has to be said - does this sub and the wider internet not notice and acknowledge its own double standards and hypocrisy? 

Boohoo Man is the same umbrella company as PLT. Oh Polly is a fast fashion company too. Yet consider the reception of Gemma’s deal compared to that of Davide, Ekin and Indiyah’s. Ekin, Davide and Indiyah’s deals are celebrated and spoken of overwhelmingly positively, yet Gemma had Greenpeace making a public statement criticising her choices and calling her the queen of toxic plastic pollution, and countless negative comments and tweets due to it being a fast fashion deal (leaving aside the fair and warranted criticism of PLT’s use of Indiyah). 99% of the commentary surrounding Gemma’s PLT deal was negative. 99% of the commentary surrounding the other deals is positive. That cannot be reconciled.

The way this sub talks about her- you’d think she’s an evil mastermind.

This sub has shown it’s hypocrisy time and time again but the reaction to Gemma made it clear that everyone becoming environmentalists overnight was nothing more than jealousy on behalf of their favourite Islanders. It’s utterly ridiculous to say you don’t care about fast fashion when it’s Indiyah as if reselling of PLT clothes is better when the supposed point was being against PLT practices in general. Also not a peep about Oh Polly being the same and for sure minimal mention of Boohoo as PLT’s parent company. The self righteousness coupled with contradiction is really cringe to watch and too many on this sub want to be holier than thou for certain Islanders and not others.

Noctex- indie Canadian brand. All of the Noctex line is hand made from deadstock textiles. Recently the owner had started selling other indie brands on her site. The Noctex brand is goth, the others more retro/vintage.

They're as legit as it gets with a fun selection of clothing, including items for babies and children. Highly recommended if your in Denver."
sewing,Project: FO,Saved a fast fashion coat with a new lining!,"I love the shape and fit of this coat purchased from Forever 21 aaaages ago, but the lining was pretty much disintegrating with each wear.  I took a seam ripper to the lining so that it could be used as a quick pattern for a new liner… probably didn’t need the seam ripper the way this thing fell to pieces!

The new witchy fabric was thrifted in a bulk bag, but has JoAnn labeling. It’s some sort of flannel softie fabric. I didn’t have enough to focus on the pattern pieces following the pattern, but luckily it’s not super noticeable with this print. After fully assembling the lining, I was able to machine sew the lining into the coat. The bottom hem and sleeves are finished with hand stitching to avoid stitches being visible on the outside. Whole project took a quick three hours, which was mostly me testing my limited knowledge of what order to sew everything 😅

Not only is the coat back in wearable shape, it’s also way warmer now, woohoo!! 🤗",2023,Love it! No sense in getting rid of it if you can still get some use out of it. 😁

The new witchy fabric was thrifted in a bulk bag, but has JoAnn labeling. It’s some sort of flannel softie fabric. I didn’t have enough to focus on the pattern pieces following the pattern, but luckily it’s not super noticeable with this print. After fully assembling the lining, I was able to machine sew the lining into the coat. The bottom hem and sleeves are finished with hand stitching to avoid stitches being visible on the outside. Whole project took a quick three hours, which was mostly me testing my limited knowledge of what order to sew everything 😅

Not only is the coat back in wearable shape, it’s also way warmer now, woohoo!! 🤗",2023,Thank you! The coat was an odd full price mall purchase for me way back in the day. I haven’t gotten my money’s worth yet haha

BeautyGuruChatter,Other Videos,Fast Beauty Is The New Fast Fashion & It Isn't Sustainable,,2019,"Before Stila was purchased by EL in 1999, they were at the forefront of sustainable packaging. Everything was cardboard. People complained and wanted sturdier packaging, though I own several of their original products, and the cardboard has held up. 
It’s been done, it worked, and maybe consumers today would accept all cardboard packaging, including on lipsticks."
BeautyGuruChatter,Other Videos,Fast Beauty Is The New Fast Fashion & It Isn't Sustainable,,2019,"One thing to note, a part of waste comes when stores have to update displays for new products they have to trash the whole insert so brands that do this whole rapid fire release thing online is slightly more sustainable as it doesn’t require stores as a middle man and the carbon footprint of that extra step is cut. I think if it’s just Colourpop in this lane it’s not as bad as say ABH trying this. I also think this trend will hopefully get people to realize that it isn’t possible or sustainable to buy every new release and start curating what we buy. What I do fear is that if brands start driving home this but it now because it might be gone tomorrow and brands without the things that Colourpop doing this feasible and not as energy intensive try it. Colourpop should definitely quit pushing plastic pressed glitter though."

BeautyGuruChatter,Other Videos,Fast Beauty Is The New Fast Fashion & It Isn't Sustainable,,2019,"Stumbled across this video by [**Jacquelyn Lovene**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqIYmrZ9UD4riaQWcyvKXgQ) and really loved the discussion she had with her viewers and herself.

One thing that really struck me is all of the things she mentioned that we, as consumers, demanded or encouraged from brands like pumps on foundation bottles, mirrors on pallettes, PR packages for purchase. So much waste for us to throw it all away when it's time for us to decultter our collections and then it begins again.

If you guys know of any more brands that you think are really excelling or at least making progress toward more sustainable products and packaging, I'd love to know so I can support them in the future (gotta keep that replacement only system going :P)

ETA: What's with ColourPop not addressing the issue of sustainable glitter? I find it really gross that they're wearing their label as the fast fashion of the makeup industry like a badge of honor instead of seeing it as a wakeup call."
BeautyGuruChatter,Other Videos,Fast Beauty Is The New Fast Fashion & It Isn't Sustainable,,2019,What I don't understand is this obsessive need to fill every eyeshadow palette with a mirror. I've rarely used palette mirrors.
BeautyGuruChatter,Other Videos,Fast Beauty Is The New Fast Fashion & It Isn't Sustainable,,2019,"I don't know....you won't even believe this but I still have a lip liner from 2009 or so. I'm like that with my make up. I have palettes from that year too, just local Australian brands like Chichi. When I don't see myself using them anymore my sister's come running to take what I have because they don't buy anything. We've alsso given a bunch of products to our poorer cousins overseas. I've mentioned before that I haven't even hit pan on any of my eye shadow palettes, just a bunch of my face powders because that's what I mostly use. When I make a purchase it's an investment. Right now I'm looking for bright pink eye shadows and you best believe I'll do my research and buy it and have it until 2030 if I'm still alive. Yes I'm a consumer but I'm not a millionaire I still have bills to pay. Anyone else the same as me?"
BeautyGuruChatter,Other Videos,Fast Beauty Is The New Fast Fashion & It Isn't Sustainable,,2019,"I think fast fashion isn't super comparable to fast beauty for the average consumer?? I personally don't throw away makeup regularly and I make an effort to use everything I own, but then again I don't buy very much makeup -- maybe a new product every few months."
BeautyGuruChatter,Other Videos,Fast Beauty Is The New Fast Fashion & It Isn't Sustainable,,2019,"And it's only going to get worse. As much noise as we all make about recycling and sustainability, we all keep consuming and buying more and more, or else why would they keep making the stuff? I get wanting to have the latest thing, especially when it's cheap, but I always go for tried and true products over the 'next new thing' where I can."
BeautyGuruChatter,Other Videos,Fast Beauty Is The New Fast Fashion & It Isn't Sustainable,,2019,"This has always made me so uncomfortable but i never knew how to address it. Personal individuals can only do so much as far as recycling, then demand brands to become eco-friendly.

This is part of why I'm such a huge fan if the popularity of Pan-Porn as well. The spirit just flies in the face of fast beauty."
BeautyGuruChatter,Other Videos,Fast Beauty Is The New Fast Fashion & It Isn't Sustainable,,2019,"The thing is though that plastic has changed, nearly all plastic used in the makeup industry is recyclable now. The industry **does** need to step up and use more recycled plastic in their products. They don’t, because it’s a more expensive raw product and they don’t think consumers will buy as many cosmetics if the prices aren’t kept low. 

Mirrors in palettes/Compacts have been around since 1940 at least. What changed everything was plastic. Makeup used to be hand made at counters and you bought your metal compact in. It was made straight into the compact. Completely reusable. I still have my mum’s Lancôme lipstick tube. It was metal and you took it to their beauty counter to be refilled with lip colour. 

However, plastic and women having more disposable cash in the 1970s changed makeup forever. By 1980 fast makeup was in full swing. You might think it’s only a problem today, but it’s been a problem for 30 years or more. 

As a consumer we literally have the power to say we want companies to use more recycled plastic, metal and paper in the construction of our makeup packaging. We also have the power to say we want more recyclable/refillable products. 

E.g if Huda made a magnetic palette and released her new eyeshadows sets in minimal plastic to be popped in to her custom magnetic palette I’d be onto it. I don’t own any Huda because she releases palettes every week it feels like. The plain fact is though, for makeup companies, the packaging costs nothing, the cost is in the ingredients and the markup on the products. Huda (and distributors) won’t make as much money if she creates more sustainable palettes, because consumers will expect the price to be lowered considerably and be less likely to buy multiples if they have to buy an expensive new case each time. The fact is a good recycled system does cost consumers more money. 

Demanding systems like this will slow down the beauty industry, people will use up what they have rather than buy a new set because of the cost. The beauty industry doesn’t want that and will fight it, unless a considerable worldwide consumer push happens. Basically, we would need to get organised on a huge level to write letters of demand. We would need people to literally stop buying makeup worldwide for a month to genuinely effect these companies into changing. 

TL:DR; consumers worldwide have to create a coordinated series of demands and protest movement for beauty companies to change.

Edit: to add, I was on a low/no buy from 2000 until 2017. Then I discovered companies doing more cardboard palettes and packaging and plastic in makeup. I buy cardboard palettes where I can. Plastic palettes could now be safely recycled (not all though, e.g Some Too Faced compacts can’t be). We can demand that companies at the very least stamp the ♻️ onto their plastic containers with the type of plastic. So we know we can pull out the mirror and metal parts and recycle each section."
BeautyGuruChatter,Other Videos,Fast Beauty Is The New Fast Fashion & It Isn't Sustainable,,2019,"I just feel ashamed of myself and the shit I've bought. I do use it (I worked from home today and still have on a full face because I like it) but I only have one face and I have more than I'll ever need.

But when she gave the stat about personal grooming items being 1/3 of waste (is that correct, I've already forgotten), that must also include shampoo bottles, deodorant, toothpaste tubes, etc. Stuff we need and go through quickly. How do we do better on that stuff?"
BeautyGuruChatter,Other Videos,Fast Beauty Is The New Fast Fashion & It Isn't Sustainable,,2019,"Yes! THIS! Since when did this makeup become collectable and not just something you use? It encourages companies to keep producing low quality crap when we all keep buying it. We should learn not to purchase things we're lukewarm about because it'll just end up in a landfill and it encourages that company to keep making more crap because it sells. We need to speak with our dollars and buy quality and not quantity. Its easier said than done but I'm personally trying to make this changeover in my own life. If we all just bought quality product and used that up it would reduce so much waste - moreso if that stuff also had more sustainable packaging. At the very least product should be used up before more is bought unless its contaminated or expired. Its sad that project pan is a thing where its a challenge to use up something you bought. Says A LOT about our culture.

With that, I feel like the point of a guru should be that they try something new and tell you if its worth buying or not to save you money/waste. But just like Yelp and every other review site the system has been corrupted into everything being amazing so that we all buy, buy, buy. Media impacts how we all see the world so if we viewers stop encouraging media to promote this crap it may help make a larger cultural change. I think if we stopped giving views to haul videos or wasteful videos it would discourage creators from wasteful purchasing for entertainment. And individually we can all do better to think about how much we throw out or how much junk is accumulating around us that will eventually be thrown out."

It's what the company was founded on, for those of you who are talking about that brand specifically. You can try to yell that to them all day and night and nothing is going to change what they are doing. They spell it out in their about section if you read it. They were created to do exactly what they have done since day one, even if you don't like it. I'm not saying I love it or I don't love it, but it is what it is. This isn't a new thing and colourpop isn't going to stop until people stop buying what they put out. Fast fashion/makeup is here and is a thing."

BeautyGuruChatter,Other Videos,Fast Beauty Is The New Fast Fashion & It Isn't Sustainable,,2019,"This. I don’t understand the whole “buy every makeup palette as soon as it comes out even if I don’t particularly like all the shades” or “own 10000 liquid lipsticks that I will never use before they all expire”. It’s so, so wasteful. 

I own around 3 palettes, all with different shades in them. I will only buy a new one if there are shades in there I don’t have. Or even better, buy an individual shade on its own! 
I also own around 5 lipsticks that I use every single one of. 

I did used to be one of those people that bought makeup for the hell of it and because it made me feel better, but for what? It’s so damn wasteful and you’re just lining the pockets of these big companies."

I was amused by the multiple Youtube comments by Indians listing all the ways that it's common for them to rewear/reuse clothes.  As a child of immigrants, so many of those little stories resonate with me.

ETA a couple facts TL;DW (too long; didn't watch):

* in 1980, the average American bought 12 new articles of clothing per year; now it's 68 new pieces/year.
* of those 68 items, half of them are worn 3x or less.
* wearing clothes 9 months longer reduces the carbon footprint of the item by 30%.
* if everyone bought 1 item used instead of new each year, it would be the equivalent of removing half a million cars from the road for a year.",2019,"Some other facts that surprised me:

On Viscose/rayon fabric:

* Viscose is made up of (on average) 33% ancient or threatened forests \[see 13:30\]
* 70% of the wood harvested for viscose ends up dumped after processing

On Green washing:

* Inditex (owner of Zara, Pull & Bear etc) claimed 88% of their waste is reused or recycled. But this is not true for all of their international factories (the ones generating the most waste) or any of their stores.
* H&M donation boxes encourage shopping by giving a discount on in-store purchases (ironic!!!)
* **Words with no legal definition:** **green, eco-friendly, ethical, responsibly-made, sustainable**

On FFA, there is so much discussion of ""sustainable"" brands.... but that word means literally *nothing* legally. Wild."

I was curious about this since the ""68"" struck me as really high, so I went back to look at my spending tracking. 

* 2019 = 24 new pieces (clothes & shoes) so far
* 2018 = 22 new pieces, 1 used

which is still double the 1980 value.  And the numbers are kinda low because there were 5-10 online purchases that got returned b/c they didn't work out for me.  So it's maybe even technically worse due to shipping/packaging.  :/

ETA: only 1 item of the 47 pieces was necessary (new waterproof boots).  Everything else was definitely a ""want"" as opposed to a need."

Most of the time I can wear an outfit from Forever 21 once before it falls apart. I used to work at a store like it and we all knew the clothing we sold was basically meant to wear once so people would come back to buy more. As a seamstress I can tell that a shirt was maybe a dollar to make (no one uses liners anymore and it pisses me off) and they are being sold for $40. I hate fast fashion for that reason. Now I have to buy designer/luxury if I want it to last. Most people don’t have that option though and I hate feeling like I wasted $30 for some skirt that is going to rip within 3 wears.

It seems to be a large problem. 

1. Quality was horrible and couldn’t be fixed. And it was also to late to return it. Like a dress that tore at a seam after 2 washes or the adorable glitter dress that shed glitter everywhere. 


2. No venture to wear a cool item. 


3. Weight fluctuations, actually needing 3 sizes during different time’s of the year. 


4. Why should consumers take all environmental responsibility? There is always the switch to blame people for not resisting a whole science aimed at making us over consume. For every item sold, two other are made at loss."

Sure people bought stuff through mail order catalogs in the 1980s, but access to brick and mortar stores is in a huge decline. The late 1970s-1980s were the height of suburban malls being built. People could shop for whatever they wanted/needed in a central location. They were safe social spaces for teenagers to hang out outside the home, and they brought all sorts of businesses into areas that previously did not have major shopping centers. Way more middle-class teenagers had part-time jobs then than they do now, due to the last recession when jobs that teenagers used to held became the only option for many adults. This isn't to say that malls were so amazing, but they don't serve the same function anymore. Many of them are closed, or full of stores that are closing. Malls in wealthy areas have department stores and high end chains that are more like advertisements for brands than actual shopping centers. 

Wealthier suburban kids tend to fill their after-school time with extracurricular activities connected to school because college is so competitive. Small businesses and luxury companies do not find it profitable to have storefronts in malls. Kids who hang out at malls tend to be from low-income backgrounds who aren't in college prep land, and the stores that have survived are places they can easily work and/or afford (Forever 21, Rainbow, Wet Seal, Charlotte Russe, Old Navy, Icing, H&M). Probably a lot of the stores are where the employees shop, and retail workers do not earn a lot of money. And these retail locations are in trouble or have already closed. The class distinctions and wealth disparities of the United States are apparent in the transformations of shopping malls. 

People who can afford luxury items do not go to brick-and-mortar stores as much as they did 30-40 years ago. They have enough money to order large quantities of things at one time and then return stuff that doesn't work. Budget companies that do not have to deal with the overhead of actual stores—Boohoo, prettylittlething—follow this model to some extent, with the exception that the clothes are super super cheap, and you can get 5 dresses for the cost of one full-price $40 forever 21 dress. So you have people buying tons of items, either because they know they can return them, or because the pieces are so cheap that it feels like a good deal. 

Sorry I have rambled so much here. But I think that a lot of these articles about fast fashion being evil don't really take into account the wealth disparities and structures of society that make fast fashion and over-consumption prevalent. Most people have less money, and they want the rush of having new items. But new items at a low cost are not sustainable because they do not last. Or they are final sale. But then people don't really have access to brick and mortar stores to see how items will actually feel and fit. People with money can order and return at will, but people without get trapped in the fast fashion cycle. Even buying secondhand or clearance from higher end stores requires a level of disposable income that can allow for mistakes."

My exceptions are underwear and work shoes, but I buy high quality (and ethically made) so they last much longer. 
Lately, consumerism and waste has been on my mind. I read an article about how many stores will destroy perfectly good clothing to preserve brand integrity or whatever rather than donate unsold items. Add in the fact that the people who make the clothes often work in sweatshops, and the employees at the stores here that sell the clothes make minimum wage. I'm rambling but anyways, I'd rather my money go to something more sustainable than say, Forever 21."

I buy less, personally, but I know people who probably buy twice that. So much stuff barely even gets worn or falls apart after the first few wears, its depressing. 

If you ever want to see the fast fashion trash machine in full effect, find yourself a Goodwill distribution center with the bin-style store. You'll find them usually in major cities. They dont sort the donations there and they bring in overflow from other, smaller locations. They just throw everything into giant bins and roll them out onto the floor. And they keep the stuff coming. Bins after bins after bins heaped high with discarded clothing. You can buy clothing by the pound. You're probably thinking 'sure, but it's all trash, right?' Not necessarily.  I was honestly shocked by some of what I saw in those bins. New stuff with tags.  Expensive stuff mixed in with heaps of fast fashion brands. I pulled two different Vera Bradley bags out without trying very hard to hunt, I like Vera and just recognized the patterns. The whole ""store"" was just piles upon piles of stuff with more coming in constantly. It was overwhelming, especially when you consider that everything in those bins probably started out with a $20+ price tag. And it refills itself constantly. The stuff hasn't been sitting for months. They swap it out constantly. Like, within hours for each bin. Its madness and when you consider how much fashion waste that truly represents, it's crazy to think about."

* in 1980, the average American bought 12 new articles of clothing per year; now it's 68 new pieces/year.
* of those 68 items, half of them are worn 3x or less.
* wearing clothes 9 months longer reduces the carbon footprint of the item by 30%.
* if everyone bought 1 item used instead of new each year, it would be the equivalent of removing half a million cars from the road for a year.",2019,"i like buying interesting fast fashion to take it apart and try to make a higher quality replica

This year i've bought (give or take) 1 pair of work trousers (50+ uses to date), 1 kilt for dancing (1-2 uses/month), around 10 pairs of socks, a tux coat for a formal dinner next weekend (projected ~1 use/month since i'll use it to replace my spring and fall jacket for dancing), 1 6 pack of underwear, 2 pride tshirts (~1 use/2 weeks), a pair of sandals to replace the ones that fell apart (3 ish uses per week in summer), and a new pair of work shoes (5 uses/week).  (I might be forgetting a band tshirt or something like that.)

So that's a total of 21 ish items, that collectively have been worn probably 350 times, for an average of 11 ish times per item.  (Work trousers, work shoes, sox, and underwear skew this of course.)

How many could i have lived without? All, of course. I could have worn the 2 pairs of old work trousers, despite their rips and broken zippers. I could do laundry more often, or wear ripped disintegrating socks and underpants (yes i mend them, but once they hit a certain threshold of threadbare, there is no more fabric remaining to attach the thread to, to do the mending).  I could make my own Pride tshirt instead of buying the same one the group wore in the parade, etc etc."

femalefashionadvice,,A Guide to Making Your Fast Fashion Clothes Last Longer,"I often see people say here that their fast fashion clothes “fall apart” and I appreciate this is a bit of a hyperbolic statement but fast fashion these days *does* feel like a race to the bottom in terms of quality. Equally, buying more sustainable clothing is not an option for everyone. But one thing we can all do is try to buy better quality within our budget and take care of our clothes to ensure they last longer. Here are my top tips on how.

**1. Look at Labels/Descriptions**

The materials used to make your clothes matter a lot but the binary of natural fibres as good and synthetic fibres as bad is not accurate. Material science is a highly advanced field and both natural and man-made textiles come in high and low quality (yes, even polyester). Cheap fast fashion does tend to be on the lower end of the quality scale but there’s a reason why some of our fast fashion items may seemingly randomly last forever and why others don’t.

- Cheap cotton is still pretty decent. E.g. for basic tops or trousers if there is a price difference between two seemingly identical items of clothing, check the fabric. Sometimes it’s 50% cotton 50% polyester vs 100% cotton. Spend a bit more, get a bit more.

- Most knitwear eventually pills, but to avoid this and the inevitable use of a fabric shaver for a bit longer, avoid knitwear with too many textiles. The more textiles, the more likely the knit is going to pill and the same goes for looser knits. Most people will champion wool and cotton but in terms of synthetic fibres for those who are allergic (like me!), acrylic is a warm and cosy choice.

- For denim, look for a high cotton percentage. Obviously, this depends on how you like your jeans to feel (more cotton = stiffer) and the style (a skinny leg jeans need to have a bit of elastane/spandex) but heavyweight cotton jeans are less likely to wear away at points of friction (e.g. the thighs) and also less likely to lose their shape over time. I go for 100% cotton in looser styles and 95% cotton/5% elastane in skinny jeans. Cheaper brands will use a lighter weight of cotton compared to say, Levis, but they still tend to be sturdier. Equally don’t pay £100 for a pair of lightweight jeans, even if they’re 100% cotton. 

- Faux leather sucks. It’s plastic and it starts peeling within a few years, even when sitting unused in your wardrobe. I avoid it, especially in shoes and bags where real leather is affordable. Vegans, we’ll chat when [mycelium](https://www.mylo-unleather.com/) and [piñatex](https://www.ananas-anam.com/) are more common, affordable and have proven their longevity. Until then, leather is often a better quality option.
- Satin is not a fabric, it’s a weave and it could be made of silk, nylon or polyester so don’t be fooled.
- You’ll often find better basics in the men’s section. Same price point, higher quality materials. 
-  Sometimes a mixture of materials is a technical decision rather than a financial one so assess what the material is doing in the clothing. Elastane adds a bit of stretch, polyester can reduce wrinkles or increase durability, nylon can be moisture wicking. 

**2. Learn How to Spot Quality in Clothing**

A higher price doesn’t *always* denote better quality, but the following factors affect cost of production, the price of the garment and improve the quality overall. 

- Lining: Coats, trousers, skirts will have an inner lining which adds warmth, thickness, comfort and increases durability. 

- Generous sizing: Whilst inconsistent sizing is a problem, cheaper clothing will just about hit the number if not slightly under on the brand's size chart. Generous sizing will be more accurate and have a bit “give” which can account for bloating, natural weight fluctuations, movement etc. which means less strain on the clothing. 


- Zips and buttons: In a similar vein, zips and buttons on dresses, skirts and trousers allow you to pull clothing over your body without straining fabric and still retaining a figure-hugging shape. Buttons last longer than zips and  zips come in a range of qualities too so I always reject items with a stiff zip.

- Seams: I’m not an expert on this but a simple test is to pull the fabric at the seams and see if it has room to stretch or whether it looks like it’s in danger of tearing. (More notes on seams in the resources below.)

- Tailoring: The more tailored an item is, the more likely it will keep its shape for longer.

*Bonus* Pattern matching: Different pieces of fabric stitched together will match at the seams and look better. 

**3. Don’t Buy Specialist Clothing from Non-Specialist Stores**

Unless you absolutely know that a fast fashion item is good quality, avoid buying something like a ski jacket or a pair of hiking boots from just anywhere. Often the reason why a store specialises in that item is because they are experts and there is technology behind it. As mentioned, materials matter and you want your technical fabrics - be the UV protecting, waterproofing, insulating - to be made by experts. In this case function is more important, fashion is a secondary factor. 

I personally consider shoes of any kind to be specialist (cobblers and tailors were historically separate professions for a reason). A few years ago, after my flat feet started complaining when I wore most of my shoes, I switched to exclusively buying from shoe brands. So far they have been more comfortable and longer lasting. It takes a lot of skill to make a good quality shoe and I just don’t think clothing brands make good quality shoes. Also if a good quality shoe wears away, you should be able to take it to a cobbler to be resoled (not had to use that option just yet so not sure how viable it is with high street shoes but definitely something to keep in mind). 

Side note: I appreciate that a lot of functional brands such as outdoorsy brands have not traditionally considered the fashion side and some still look like they haven’t changed their designs for 20 years ago BUT I think that’s changed a lot in recent years and you can get some gorgeous stuff at Passenger, Finisterre or The North Face that both looks good and is highly functional. 

**4. Laundry**

Gentle laundry is probably the top thing you can do for your clothes. Unless you are sweating through them or they are socks/underwear, you do not need to wash every item every time you wear it. The further something is away from direct contact with your skin, the less often it needs a wash. Spot clean if possible first (the corner of a towel works well for this).

*Washing* 

- Wash at a cooler temperature. Apart from bedding, towels and face masks that need a higher temperature to kill germs, I wash everything at 30°C.

- Avoid fabric softener. It’s not needed for most clothing but for activewear in particular it reduces the moisture wicking quality, traps sweat and reduces elasticity. 

- Wash your clothing inside out. Pilling happens as a result of friction when clothes rub against each other. This happens far more intensely in the washing machine than when you’re wearing them. Printed t-shirts will also retain their pattern longer and clothing with details like zips, beads or gems will stay secure and are less likely to damage other clothing if they are inside out.

- Do up zips, hook bras together and separate items into netted wash bags if they need a little bit of babying. Ideally wash bras by hand or on a delicate cycle to protect the cups and underwire.

*Drying*

There are valid reasons to not dry your clothes outside but if your excuse is laziness here’s your reminder that **heat from the dryer shortens the shelf life of your clothing**. I live in the UK and I will happily dry laundry outside between May to Octoberish and then I shift to using a dryer in the cooler seasons. I’ve also definitely taken advantage of working remotely and hanging clothes out to dry during the work day so sometimes it's just about stealing time here and there to accommodate it.

- You can partially dry things outside and then put them in the dryer to get the last bit of moisture out. Or vice versa, depending on the weather and what you’re drying.

- Some clothing, such as cotton and jersey fabrics, tend to dry more slowly so if you are using a tumble dryer, pull out lightweight clothing halfway so that they aren’t being blasted with heat for no reason.

- If you are in the position of buying a dryer, opt for one with settings for delicates and activewear.

Side note: I wouldn’t recommend drying all of your laundry on the radiator. All of that moisture has to go somewhere and if that place is your walls and ceiling, it is a guaranteed recipe for mould. 

*I don’t separate my darks/lights/coloured...*

because I mostly own synthetic clothing where the colour doesn’t bleed. Imagine my shock and disappointment when a secondhand cotton skirt bled a rust shade onto my white bamboo gym top. Lesson learnt - I now do a test run for new clothes and secondhand clothes and anything that bleeds will get a dedicated 15 minute cycle when it needs washing. 

**5. Learn How to Sew a Teensy Bit**

I’m not going to preach about the wonders of sewing your own clothes. I am not interested in sewing. I recently tried to hem a secondhand dress, with the guidance of my mother who is a very skilled seamstress. I spent over an hour hand stitching the hemline but somehow ruined the shape, despite my mum saying that my handiwork looked fine. So the problem is that sewing is hard and I am not invested enough in learning. ^(I will probably learn how to hem because most clothing is too long for me and I refuse to pay someone for a job I know I *could* do with a bit of practice but the point is sewing is a skill and I have no desire to *master* it.)

HOWEVER, I come from a culture where tailoring was the norm up until very recently and most women know how to sew in some capacity so I have picked up on some useful things. Basically my advice is to learn how to make tiny alterations that can keep clothing functional for a bit longer or slightly improve upon something that has been cheaply made, such as:

- Securing loose buttons (especially useful for coats)
- Sewing snap buttons for gapey tops 
- Stitching up loose seams when they come undone
- Securing straps on a top if you’re in danger of flashing a stranger the next time you wear it
- Removing extras you don’t like from clothing with a stitch picker

Those are my big points on how to get the best out of your fast fashion though there are lots of little things you can do to take care of your clothes too. 

I really didn’t expect it to be this long but I'm trying to be a more ""conscious consumer"" - part of that is moving away from fast fashion but it’s difficult to do so completely. So when I do shop fast fashion, I’m trying to raise my standards for what I'm willing to buy from fast fashion and only go for items that are good enough quality to last a long time. 

I would also love to hear your tips and tricks!",2021,"I have to say, I’ve just never had an issue with fast fashion clothes not lasting. I’m fairly surprised every time I see anyone talk about this. I guess sometimes the quality can be not great, but I’ve never had pieces completely fall apart on me."

Those are my big points on how to get the best out of your fast fashion though there are lots of little things you can do to take care of your clothes too. 

I really didn’t expect it to be this long but I'm trying to be a more ""conscious consumer"" - part of that is moving away from fast fashion but it’s difficult to do so completely. So when I do shop fast fashion, I’m trying to raise my standards for what I'm willing to buy from fast fashion and only go for items that are good enough quality to last a long time. 

I would also love to hear your tips and tricks!",2021,"Wear base layers! You briefly touched on linings, which are reasonably common even in fast fashion, but not always there. If your skirt or dress doesn’t have a lining (slip plus lining is a recipe for frustration and unnecessary) put on a slip. Then you wash the slip more frequently, based on sweat and/or after x number of wears. 

With sweaters, even thin ones, I always wear a camisole/spaghetti strap tank top at least. I live in the sub tropics, it’s hot, I get it, but truly it doesn’t make me warmer and it protects the knits. 

Finally, most materials other than leather, some silks, and highly embellished stuff, can be washed on delicate. If the label says dry clean only on like, cotton, I presume they don’t trust their manufacturing and didn’t prewash anything. I still may buy it, but it does contribute to my assessment of quality."
femalefashionadvice,,A Guide to Making Your Fast Fashion Clothes Last Longer,"I often see people say here that their fast fashion clothes “fall apart” and I appreciate this is a bit of a hyperbolic statement but fast fashion these days *does* feel like a race to the bottom in terms of quality. Equally, buying more sustainable clothing is not an option for everyone. But one thing we can all do is try to buy better quality within our budget and take care of our clothes to ensure they last longer. Here are my top tips on how.

**1. Look at Labels/Descriptions**

The materials used to make your clothes matter a lot but the binary of natural fibres as good and synthetic fibres as bad is not accurate. Material science is a highly advanced field and both natural and man-made textiles come in high and low quality (yes, even polyester). Cheap fast fashion does tend to be on the lower end of the quality scale but there’s a reason why some of our fast fashion items may seemingly randomly last forever and why others don’t.

- Cheap cotton is still pretty decent. E.g. for basic tops or trousers if there is a price difference between two seemingly identical items of clothing, check the fabric. Sometimes it’s 50% cotton 50% polyester vs 100% cotton. Spend a bit more, get a bit more.

- Most knitwear eventually pills, but to avoid this and the inevitable use of a fabric shaver for a bit longer, avoid knitwear with too many textiles. The more textiles, the more likely the knit is going to pill and the same goes for looser knits. Most people will champion wool and cotton but in terms of synthetic fibres for those who are allergic (like me!), acrylic is a warm and cosy choice.

- For denim, look for a high cotton percentage. Obviously, this depends on how you like your jeans to feel (more cotton = stiffer) and the style (a skinny leg jeans need to have a bit of elastane/spandex) but heavyweight cotton jeans are less likely to wear away at points of friction (e.g. the thighs) and also less likely to lose their shape over time. I go for 100% cotton in looser styles and 95% cotton/5% elastane in skinny jeans. Cheaper brands will use a lighter weight of cotton compared to say, Levis, but they still tend to be sturdier. Equally don’t pay £100 for a pair of lightweight jeans, even if they’re 100% cotton. 

- Faux leather sucks. It’s plastic and it starts peeling within a few years, even when sitting unused in your wardrobe. I avoid it, especially in shoes and bags where real leather is affordable. Vegans, we’ll chat when [mycelium](https://www.mylo-unleather.com/) and [piñatex](https://www.ananas-anam.com/) are more common, affordable and have proven their longevity. Until then, leather is often a better quality option.
- Satin is not a fabric, it’s a weave and it could be made of silk, nylon or polyester so don’t be fooled.
- You’ll often find better basics in the men’s section. Same price point, higher quality materials. 
-  Sometimes a mixture of materials is a technical decision rather than a financial one so assess what the material is doing in the clothing. Elastane adds a bit of stretch, polyester can reduce wrinkles or increase durability, nylon can be moisture wicking. 

**2. Learn How to Spot Quality in Clothing**

A higher price doesn’t *always* denote better quality, but the following factors affect cost of production, the price of the garment and improve the quality overall. 

- Lining: Coats, trousers, skirts will have an inner lining which adds warmth, thickness, comfort and increases durability. 

- Generous sizing: Whilst inconsistent sizing is a problem, cheaper clothing will just about hit the number if not slightly under on the brand's size chart. Generous sizing will be more accurate and have a bit “give” which can account for bloating, natural weight fluctuations, movement etc. which means less strain on the clothing. 


- Zips and buttons: In a similar vein, zips and buttons on dresses, skirts and trousers allow you to pull clothing over your body without straining fabric and still retaining a figure-hugging shape. Buttons last longer than zips and  zips come in a range of qualities too so I always reject items with a stiff zip.

- Seams: I’m not an expert on this but a simple test is to pull the fabric at the seams and see if it has room to stretch or whether it looks like it’s in danger of tearing. (More notes on seams in the resources below.)

- Tailoring: The more tailored an item is, the more likely it will keep its shape for longer.

*Bonus* Pattern matching: Different pieces of fabric stitched together will match at the seams and look better. 

**3. Don’t Buy Specialist Clothing from Non-Specialist Stores**

Unless you absolutely know that a fast fashion item is good quality, avoid buying something like a ski jacket or a pair of hiking boots from just anywhere. Often the reason why a store specialises in that item is because they are experts and there is technology behind it. As mentioned, materials matter and you want your technical fabrics - be the UV protecting, waterproofing, insulating - to be made by experts. In this case function is more important, fashion is a secondary factor. 

I personally consider shoes of any kind to be specialist (cobblers and tailors were historically separate professions for a reason). A few years ago, after my flat feet started complaining when I wore most of my shoes, I switched to exclusively buying from shoe brands. So far they have been more comfortable and longer lasting. It takes a lot of skill to make a good quality shoe and I just don’t think clothing brands make good quality shoes. Also if a good quality shoe wears away, you should be able to take it to a cobbler to be resoled (not had to use that option just yet so not sure how viable it is with high street shoes but definitely something to keep in mind). 

Side note: I appreciate that a lot of functional brands such as outdoorsy brands have not traditionally considered the fashion side and some still look like they haven’t changed their designs for 20 years ago BUT I think that’s changed a lot in recent years and you can get some gorgeous stuff at Passenger, Finisterre or The North Face that both looks good and is highly functional. 

**4. Laundry**

Gentle laundry is probably the top thing you can do for your clothes. Unless you are sweating through them or they are socks/underwear, you do not need to wash every item every time you wear it. The further something is away from direct contact with your skin, the less often it needs a wash. Spot clean if possible first (the corner of a towel works well for this).

*Washing* 

- Wash at a cooler temperature. Apart from bedding, towels and face masks that need a higher temperature to kill germs, I wash everything at 30°C.

- Avoid fabric softener. It’s not needed for most clothing but for activewear in particular it reduces the moisture wicking quality, traps sweat and reduces elasticity. 

- Wash your clothing inside out. Pilling happens as a result of friction when clothes rub against each other. This happens far more intensely in the washing machine than when you’re wearing them. Printed t-shirts will also retain their pattern longer and clothing with details like zips, beads or gems will stay secure and are less likely to damage other clothing if they are inside out.

- Do up zips, hook bras together and separate items into netted wash bags if they need a little bit of babying. Ideally wash bras by hand or on a delicate cycle to protect the cups and underwire.

*Drying*

There are valid reasons to not dry your clothes outside but if your excuse is laziness here’s your reminder that **heat from the dryer shortens the shelf life of your clothing**. I live in the UK and I will happily dry laundry outside between May to Octoberish and then I shift to using a dryer in the cooler seasons. I’ve also definitely taken advantage of working remotely and hanging clothes out to dry during the work day so sometimes it's just about stealing time here and there to accommodate it.

- You can partially dry things outside and then put them in the dryer to get the last bit of moisture out. Or vice versa, depending on the weather and what you’re drying.

- Some clothing, such as cotton and jersey fabrics, tend to dry more slowly so if you are using a tumble dryer, pull out lightweight clothing halfway so that they aren’t being blasted with heat for no reason.

- If you are in the position of buying a dryer, opt for one with settings for delicates and activewear.

Side note: I wouldn’t recommend drying all of your laundry on the radiator. All of that moisture has to go somewhere and if that place is your walls and ceiling, it is a guaranteed recipe for mould. 

*I don’t separate my darks/lights/coloured...*

because I mostly own synthetic clothing where the colour doesn’t bleed. Imagine my shock and disappointment when a secondhand cotton skirt bled a rust shade onto my white bamboo gym top. Lesson learnt - I now do a test run for new clothes and secondhand clothes and anything that bleeds will get a dedicated 15 minute cycle when it needs washing. 

**5. Learn How to Sew a Teensy Bit**

I’m not going to preach about the wonders of sewing your own clothes. I am not interested in sewing. I recently tried to hem a secondhand dress, with the guidance of my mother who is a very skilled seamstress. I spent over an hour hand stitching the hemline but somehow ruined the shape, despite my mum saying that my handiwork looked fine. So the problem is that sewing is hard and I am not invested enough in learning. ^(I will probably learn how to hem because most clothing is too long for me and I refuse to pay someone for a job I know I *could* do with a bit of practice but the point is sewing is a skill and I have no desire to *master* it.)

HOWEVER, I come from a culture where tailoring was the norm up until very recently and most women know how to sew in some capacity so I have picked up on some useful things. Basically my advice is to learn how to make tiny alterations that can keep clothing functional for a bit longer or slightly improve upon something that has been cheaply made, such as:

- Securing loose buttons (especially useful for coats)
- Sewing snap buttons for gapey tops 
- Stitching up loose seams when they come undone
- Securing straps on a top if you’re in danger of flashing a stranger the next time you wear it
- Removing extras you don’t like from clothing with a stitch picker

Cheap fast fashion does tend to be on the lower end of the quality scale but there’s a reason why some of our fast fashion items may seemingly randomly last forever and why others don’t.

- Cheap cotton is still pretty decent. E.g. for basic tops or trousers if there is a price difference between two seemingly identical items of clothing, check the fabric. Sometimes it’s 50% cotton 50% polyester vs 100% cotton. Spend a bit more, get a bit more.

- Most knitwear eventually pills, but to avoid this and the inevitable use of a fabric shaver for a bit longer, avoid knitwear with too many textiles. The more textiles, the more likely the knit is going to pill and the same goes for looser knits. Most people will champion wool and cotton but in terms of synthetic fibres for those who are allergic (like me!), acrylic is a warm and cosy choice.

- For denim, look for a high cotton percentage. Obviously, this depends on how you like your jeans to feel (more cotton = stiffer) and the style (a skinny leg jeans need to have a bit of elastane/spandex) but heavyweight cotton jeans are less likely to wear away at points of friction (e.g. the thighs) and also less likely to lose their shape over time. I go for 100% cotton in looser styles and 95% cotton/5% elastane in skinny jeans. Cheaper brands will use a lighter weight of cotton compared to say, Levis, but they still tend to be sturdier. Equally don’t pay £100 for a pair of lightweight jeans, even if they’re 100% cotton. 

- Faux leather sucks. It’s plastic and it starts peeling within a few years, even when sitting unused in your wardrobe. I avoid it, especially in shoes and bags where real leather is affordable. Vegans, we’ll chat when [mycelium](https://www.mylo-unleather.com/) and [piñatex](https://www.ananas-anam.com/) are more common, affordable and have proven their longevity. Until then, leather is often a better quality option.
- Satin is not a fabric, it’s a weave and it could be made of silk, nylon or polyester so don’t be fooled.
- You’ll often find better basics in the men’s section. Same price point, higher quality materials. 
-  Sometimes a mixture of materials is a technical decision rather than a financial one so assess what the material is doing in the clothing. Elastane adds a bit of stretch, polyester can reduce wrinkles or increase durability, nylon can be moisture wicking. 

**2. Learn How to Spot Quality in Clothing**

A higher price doesn’t *always* denote better quality, but the following factors affect cost of production, the price of the garment and improve the quality overall. 

- Lining: Coats, trousers, skirts will have an inner lining which adds warmth, thickness, comfort and increases durability. 

- Generous sizing: Whilst inconsistent sizing is a problem, cheaper clothing will just about hit the number if not slightly under on the brand's size chart. Generous sizing will be more accurate and have a bit “give” which can account for bloating, natural weight fluctuations, movement etc. which means less strain on the clothing. 


- Zips and buttons: In a similar vein, zips and buttons on dresses, skirts and trousers allow you to pull clothing over your body without straining fabric and still retaining a figure-hugging shape. Buttons last longer than zips and  zips come in a range of qualities too so I always reject items with a stiff zip.

- Seams: I’m not an expert on this but a simple test is to pull the fabric at the seams and see if it has room to stretch or whether it looks like it’s in danger of tearing. (More notes on seams in the resources below.)

- Tailoring: The more tailored an item is, the more likely it will keep its shape for longer.

*Bonus* Pattern matching: Different pieces of fabric stitched together will match at the seams and look better. 

**3. Don’t Buy Specialist Clothing from Non-Specialist Stores**

Unless you absolutely know that a fast fashion item is good quality, avoid buying something like a ski jacket or a pair of hiking boots from just anywhere. Often the reason why a store specialises in that item is because they are experts and there is technology behind it. As mentioned, materials matter and you want your technical fabrics - be the UV protecting, waterproofing, insulating - to be made by experts. In this case function is more important, fashion is a secondary factor. 

I personally consider shoes of any kind to be specialist (cobblers and tailors were historically separate professions for a reason). A few years ago, after my flat feet started complaining when I wore most of my shoes, I switched to exclusively buying from shoe brands. So far they have been more comfortable and longer lasting. It takes a lot of skill to make a good quality shoe and I just don’t think clothing brands make good quality shoes. Also if a good quality shoe wears away, you should be able to take it to a cobbler to be resoled (not had to use that option just yet so not sure how viable it is with high street shoes but definitely something to keep in mind). 

Side note: I appreciate that a lot of functional brands such as outdoorsy brands have not traditionally considered the fashion side and some still look like they haven’t changed their designs for 20 years ago BUT I think that’s changed a lot in recent years and you can get some gorgeous stuff at Passenger, Finisterre or The North Face that both looks good and is highly functional. 

**4. Laundry**

Gentle laundry is probably the top thing you can do for your clothes. Unless you are sweating through them or they are socks/underwear, you do not need to wash every item every time you wear it. The further something is away from direct contact with your skin, the less often it needs a wash. Spot clean if possible first (the corner of a towel works well for this).

*Washing* 

- Wash at a cooler temperature. Apart from bedding, towels and face masks that need a higher temperature to kill germs, I wash everything at 30°C.

- Avoid fabric softener. It’s not needed for most clothing but for activewear in particular it reduces the moisture wicking quality, traps sweat and reduces elasticity. 

- Wash your clothing inside out. Pilling happens as a result of friction when clothes rub against each other. This happens far more intensely in the washing machine than when you’re wearing them. Printed t-shirts will also retain their pattern longer and clothing with details like zips, beads or gems will stay secure and are less likely to damage other clothing if they are inside out.

- Do up zips, hook bras together and separate items into netted wash bags if they need a little bit of babying. Ideally wash bras by hand or on a delicate cycle to protect the cups and underwire.

*Drying*

There are valid reasons to not dry your clothes outside but if your excuse is laziness here’s your reminder that **heat from the dryer shortens the shelf life of your clothing**. I live in the UK and I will happily dry laundry outside between May to Octoberish and then I shift to using a dryer in the cooler seasons. I’ve also definitely taken advantage of working remotely and hanging clothes out to dry during the work day so sometimes it's just about stealing time here and there to accommodate it.

- You can partially dry things outside and then put them in the dryer to get the last bit of moisture out. Or vice versa, depending on the weather and what you’re drying.

- Some clothing, such as cotton and jersey fabrics, tend to dry more slowly so if you are using a tumble dryer, pull out lightweight clothing halfway so that they aren’t being blasted with heat for no reason.

- If you are in the position of buying a dryer, opt for one with settings for delicates and activewear.

Side note: I wouldn’t recommend drying all of your laundry on the radiator. All of that moisture has to go somewhere and if that place is your walls and ceiling, it is a guaranteed recipe for mould. 

*I don’t separate my darks/lights/coloured...*

because I mostly own synthetic clothing where the colour doesn’t bleed. Imagine my shock and disappointment when a secondhand cotton skirt bled a rust shade onto my white bamboo gym top. Lesson learnt - I now do a test run for new clothes and secondhand clothes and anything that bleeds will get a dedicated 15 minute cycle when it needs washing. 

**5. Learn How to Sew a Teensy Bit**

I’m not going to preach about the wonders of sewing your own clothes. I am not interested in sewing. I recently tried to hem a secondhand dress, with the guidance of my mother who is a very skilled seamstress. I spent over an hour hand stitching the hemline but somehow ruined the shape, despite my mum saying that my handiwork looked fine. So the problem is that sewing is hard and I am not invested enough in learning. ^(I will probably learn how to hem because most clothing is too long for me and I refuse to pay someone for a job I know I *could* do with a bit of practice but the point is sewing is a skill and I have no desire to *master* it.)

HOWEVER, I come from a culture where tailoring was the norm up until very recently and most women know how to sew in some capacity so I have picked up on some useful things. Basically my advice is to learn how to make tiny alterations that can keep clothing functional for a bit longer or slightly improve upon something that has been cheaply made, such as:

- Securing loose buttons (especially useful for coats)
- Sewing snap buttons for gapey tops 
- Stitching up loose seams when they come undone
- Securing straps on a top if you’re in danger of flashing a stranger the next time you wear it
- Removing extras you don’t like from clothing with a stitch picker

Those are my big points on how to get the best out of your fast fashion though there are lots of little things you can do to take care of your clothes too. 

I really didn’t expect it to be this long but I'm trying to be a more ""conscious consumer"" - part of that is moving away from fast fashion but it’s difficult to do so completely. So when I do shop fast fashion, I’m trying to raise my standards for what I'm willing to buy from fast fashion and only go for items that are good enough quality to last a long time. 

I would also love to hear your tips and tricks!",2021,"Seams: good seams will last longer. If you can see loose threads or the stitching looks uneven, chances are it will start to fall apart/flip up unattractively faster."
femalefashionadvice,,A Guide to Making Your Fast Fashion Clothes Last Longer,"I often see people say here that their fast fashion clothes “fall apart” and I appreciate this is a bit of a hyperbolic statement but fast fashion these days *does* feel like a race to the bottom in terms of quality. Equally, buying more sustainable clothing is not an option for everyone. But one thing we can all do is try to buy better quality within our budget and take care of our clothes to ensure they last longer. Here are my top tips on how.

Back home, we have our own ethnic clothing that's mostly 100% cotton and superbly colorful, and this is what I used to do. The first dousing would take off extra color from the cotton and take care of any shrinking (some cotton also shrinks, and natural linen does too). I haven't been buying cotton stuff found in the western market for long (I now live in Germany) so that's why I don't know if this works here, because ""100% cotton"" can have a lot of variety and not all cottons bleed color."

Side note: I appreciate that a lot of functional brands such as outdoorsy brands have not traditionally considered the fashion side and some still look like they haven’t changed their designs for 20 years ago BUT I think that’s changed a lot in recent years and you can get some gorgeous stuff at Passenger, Finisterre or The North Face that both looks good and is highly functional. 

**4. Laundry**

Gentle laundry is probably the top thing you can do for your clothes. Unless you are sweating through them or they are socks/underwear, you do not need to wash every item every time you wear it. The further something is away from direct contact with your skin, the less often it needs a wash. Spot clean if possible first (the corner of a towel works well for this).

*Washing* 

- Wash at a cooler temperature. Apart from bedding, towels and face masks that need a higher temperature to kill germs, I wash everything at 30°C.

- Avoid fabric softener. It’s not needed for most clothing but for activewear in particular it reduces the moisture wicking quality, traps sweat and reduces elasticity. 

- Wash your clothing inside out. Pilling happens as a result of friction when clothes rub against each other. This happens far more intensely in the washing machine than when you’re wearing them. Printed t-shirts will also retain their pattern longer and clothing with details like zips, beads or gems will stay secure and are less likely to damage other clothing if they are inside out.

- Do up zips, hook bras together and separate items into netted wash bags if they need a little bit of babying. Ideally wash bras by hand or on a delicate cycle to protect the cups and underwire.

*Drying*

There are valid reasons to not dry your clothes outside but if your excuse is laziness here’s your reminder that **heat from the dryer shortens the shelf life of your clothing**. I live in the UK and I will happily dry laundry outside between May to Octoberish and then I shift to using a dryer in the cooler seasons. I’ve also definitely taken advantage of working remotely and hanging clothes out to dry during the work day so sometimes it's just about stealing time here and there to accommodate it.

- You can partially dry things outside and then put them in the dryer to get the last bit of moisture out. Or vice versa, depending on the weather and what you’re drying.

- Some clothing, such as cotton and jersey fabrics, tend to dry more slowly so if you are using a tumble dryer, pull out lightweight clothing halfway so that they aren’t being blasted with heat for no reason.

- If you are in the position of buying a dryer, opt for one with settings for delicates and activewear.

Side note: I wouldn’t recommend drying all of your laundry on the radiator. All of that moisture has to go somewhere and if that place is your walls and ceiling, it is a guaranteed recipe for mould. 

*I don’t separate my darks/lights/coloured...*

because I mostly own synthetic clothing where the colour doesn’t bleed. Imagine my shock and disappointment when a secondhand cotton skirt bled a rust shade onto my white bamboo gym top. Lesson learnt - I now do a test run for new clothes and secondhand clothes and anything that bleeds will get a dedicated 15 minute cycle when it needs washing. 

**5. Learn How to Sew a Teensy Bit**

I’m not going to preach about the wonders of sewing your own clothes. I am not interested in sewing. I recently tried to hem a secondhand dress, with the guidance of my mother who is a very skilled seamstress. I spent over an hour hand stitching the hemline but somehow ruined the shape, despite my mum saying that my handiwork looked fine. So the problem is that sewing is hard and I am not invested enough in learning. ^(I will probably learn how to hem because most clothing is too long for me and I refuse to pay someone for a job I know I *could* do with a bit of practice but the point is sewing is a skill and I have no desire to *master* it.)

HOWEVER, I come from a culture where tailoring was the norm up until very recently and most women know how to sew in some capacity so I have picked up on some useful things. Basically my advice is to learn how to make tiny alterations that can keep clothing functional for a bit longer or slightly improve upon something that has been cheaply made, such as:

- Securing loose buttons (especially useful for coats)
- Sewing snap buttons for gapey tops 
- Stitching up loose seams when they come undone
- Securing straps on a top if you’re in danger of flashing a stranger the next time you wear it
- Removing extras you don’t like from clothing with a stitch picker

[How to care for clothes + 6 laundry hacks | Justine Leconte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtmB2A5Fkf4)

Those are my big points on how to get the best out of your fast fashion though there are lots of little things you can do to take care of your clothes too. 

I really didn’t expect it to be this long but I'm trying to be a more ""conscious consumer"" - part of that is moving away from fast fashion but it’s difficult to do so completely. So when I do shop fast fashion, I’m trying to raise my standards for what I'm willing to buy from fast fashion and only go for items that are good enough quality to last a long time. 

I would also love to hear your tips and tricks!",2021,"For me: yeah, just don’t dryer dry your clothing. Just don’t do it. 

And don’t purchase things where thread is loose, or the thread looks bad quality- *unless* you wanna fix it yourself and like that sort of thing."
femalefashionadvice,,A Guide to Making Your Fast Fashion Clothes Last Longer,"I often see people say here that their fast fashion clothes “fall apart” and I appreciate this is a bit of a hyperbolic statement but fast fashion these days *does* feel like a race to the bottom in terms of quality. Equally, buying more sustainable clothing is not an option for everyone. But one thing we can all do is try to buy better quality within our budget and take care of our clothes to ensure they last longer. Here are my top tips on how.

**1. Look at Labels/Descriptions**

The materials used to make your clothes matter a lot but the binary of natural fibres as good and synthetic fibres as bad is not accurate. Material science is a highly advanced field and both natural and man-made textiles come in high and low quality (yes, even polyester). Cheap fast fashion does tend to be on the lower end of the quality scale but there’s a reason why some of our fast fashion items may seemingly randomly last forever and why others don’t.

- Cheap cotton is still pretty decent. E.g. for basic tops or trousers if there is a price difference between two seemingly identical items of clothing, check the fabric. Sometimes it’s 50% cotton 50% polyester vs 100% cotton. Spend a bit more, get a bit more.

- Most knitwear eventually pills, but to avoid this and the inevitable use of a fabric shaver for a bit longer, avoid knitwear with too many textiles. The more textiles, the more likely the knit is going to pill and the same goes for looser knits. Most people will champion wool and cotton but in terms of synthetic fibres for those who are allergic (like me!), acrylic is a warm and cosy choice.

- For denim, look for a high cotton percentage. Obviously, this depends on how you like your jeans to feel (more cotton = stiffer) and the style (a skinny leg jeans need to have a bit of elastane/spandex) but heavyweight cotton jeans are less likely to wear away at points of friction (e.g. the thighs) and also less likely to lose their shape over time. I go for 100% cotton in looser styles and 95% cotton/5% elastane in skinny jeans. Cheaper brands will use a lighter weight of cotton compared to say, Levis, but they still tend to be sturdier. Equally don’t pay £100 for a pair of lightweight jeans, even if they’re 100% cotton. 

- Faux leather sucks. It’s plastic and it starts peeling within a few years, even when sitting unused in your wardrobe. I avoid it, especially in shoes and bags where real leather is affordable. Vegans, we’ll chat when [mycelium](https://www.mylo-unleather.com/) and [piñatex](https://www.ananas-anam.com/) are more common, affordable and have proven their longevity. Until then, leather is often a better quality option.
- Satin is not a fabric, it’s a weave and it could be made of silk, nylon or polyester so don’t be fooled.
- You’ll often find better basics in the men’s section. Same price point, higher quality materials. 
-  Sometimes a mixture of materials is a technical decision rather than a financial one so assess what the material is doing in the clothing. Elastane adds a bit of stretch, polyester can reduce wrinkles or increase durability, nylon can be moisture wicking. 

**2. Learn How to Spot Quality in Clothing**

A higher price doesn’t *always* denote better quality, but the following factors affect cost of production, the price of the garment and improve the quality overall. 

- Lining: Coats, trousers, skirts will have an inner lining which adds warmth, thickness, comfort and increases durability. 

- Generous sizing: Whilst inconsistent sizing is a problem, cheaper clothing will just about hit the number if not slightly under on the brand's size chart. Generous sizing will be more accurate and have a bit “give” which can account for bloating, natural weight fluctuations, movement etc. which means less strain on the clothing. 


- Zips and buttons: In a similar vein, zips and buttons on dresses, skirts and trousers allow you to pull clothing over your body without straining fabric and still retaining a figure-hugging shape. Buttons last longer than zips and  zips come in a range of qualities too so I always reject items with a stiff zip.

- Seams: I’m not an expert on this but a simple test is to pull the fabric at the seams and see if it has room to stretch or whether it looks like it’s in danger of tearing. (More notes on seams in the resources below.)

- Tailoring: The more tailored an item is, the more likely it will keep its shape for longer.

*Bonus* Pattern matching: Different pieces of fabric stitched together will match at the seams and look better. 

**3. Don’t Buy Specialist Clothing from Non-Specialist Stores**

Unless you absolutely know that a fast fashion item is good quality, avoid buying something like a ski jacket or a pair of hiking boots from just anywhere. Often the reason why a store specialises in that item is because they are experts and there is technology behind it. As mentioned, materials matter and you want your technical fabrics - be the UV protecting, waterproofing, insulating - to be made by experts. In this case function is more important, fashion is a secondary factor. 

I personally consider shoes of any kind to be specialist (cobblers and tailors were historically separate professions for a reason). A few years ago, after my flat feet started complaining when I wore most of my shoes, I switched to exclusively buying from shoe brands. So far they have been more comfortable and longer lasting. It takes a lot of skill to make a good quality shoe and I just don’t think clothing brands make good quality shoes. Also if a good quality shoe wears away, you should be able to take it to a cobbler to be resoled (not had to use that option just yet so not sure how viable it is with high street shoes but definitely something to keep in mind). 

Side note: I appreciate that a lot of functional brands such as outdoorsy brands have not traditionally considered the fashion side and some still look like they haven’t changed their designs for 20 years ago BUT I think that’s changed a lot in recent years and you can get some gorgeous stuff at Passenger, Finisterre or The North Face that both looks good and is highly functional.

[How to care for clothes + 6 laundry hacks | Justine Leconte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtmB2A5Fkf4)

Those are my big points on how to get the best out of your fast fashion though there are lots of little things you can do to take care of your clothes too. 

I really didn’t expect it to be this long but I'm trying to be a more ""conscious consumer"" - part of that is moving away from fast fashion but it’s difficult to do so completely. So when I do shop fast fashion, I’m trying to raise my standards for what I'm willing to buy from fast fashion and only go for items that are good enough quality to last a long time. 

I would also love to hear your tips and tricks!",2021,"I soak and handwash all the fast fashion (usually cotton blend, polyester, modal, maybe cotton linen blend) that I care to wear for a long time in a large salad spinner with a delicate knitter’s detergent (called Soak Lacey) and hang dry outside. I let it soak while I shower, so it usually only takes 2-3 minutes of actually handwashing/pressing the salad spinner. Most of my clothes will probably outlive me."
femalefashionadvice,,A Guide to Making Your Fast Fashion Clothes Last Longer,"I often see people say here that their fast fashion clothes “fall apart” and I appreciate this is a bit of a hyperbolic statement but fast fashion these days *does* feel like a race to the bottom in terms of quality. Equally, buying more sustainable clothing is not an option for everyone. But one thing we can all do is try to buy better quality within our budget and take care of our clothes to ensure they last longer. Here are my top tips on how.

**1. Look at Labels/Descriptions**

The materials used to make your clothes matter a lot but the binary of natural fibres as good and synthetic fibres as bad is not accurate. Material science is a highly advanced field and both natural and man-made textiles come in high and low quality (yes, even polyester). Cheap fast fashion does tend to be on the lower end of the quality scale but there’s a reason why some of our fast fashion items may seemingly randomly last forever and why others don’t.

- Cheap cotton is still pretty decent. E.g. for basic tops or trousers if there is a price difference between two seemingly identical items of clothing, check the fabric. Sometimes it’s 50% cotton 50% polyester vs 100% cotton. Spend a bit more, get a bit more.

- Most knitwear eventually pills, but to avoid this and the inevitable use of a fabric shaver for a bit longer, avoid knitwear with too many textiles. The more textiles, the more likely the knit is going to pill and the same goes for looser knits. Most people will champion wool and cotton but in terms of synthetic fibres for those who are allergic (like me!), acrylic is a warm and cosy choice.

- For denim, look for a high cotton percentage. Obviously, this depends on how you like your jeans to feel (more cotton = stiffer) and the style (a skinny leg jeans need to have a bit of elastane/spandex) but heavyweight cotton jeans are less likely to wear away at points of friction (e.g. the thighs) and also less likely to lose their shape over time. I go for 100% cotton in looser styles and 95% cotton/5% elastane in skinny jeans. Cheaper brands will use a lighter weight of cotton compared to say, Levis, but they still tend to be sturdier. Equally don’t pay £100 for a pair of lightweight jeans, even if they’re 100% cotton. 

- Faux leather sucks. It’s plastic and it starts peeling within a few years, even when sitting unused in your wardrobe. I avoid it, especially in shoes and bags where real leather is affordable. Vegans, we’ll chat when [mycelium](https://www.mylo-unleather.com/) and [piñatex](https://www.ananas-anam.com/) are more common, affordable and have proven their longevity. Until then, leather is often a better quality option.
- Satin is not a fabric, it’s a weave and it could be made of silk, nylon or polyester so don’t be fooled.
- You’ll often find better basics in the men’s section. Same price point, higher quality materials. 
-  Sometimes a mixture of materials is a technical decision rather than a financial one so assess what the material is doing in the clothing. Elastane adds a bit of stretch, polyester can reduce wrinkles or increase durability, nylon can be moisture wicking. 

**2. Learn How to Spot Quality in Clothing**

A higher price doesn’t *always* denote better quality, but the following factors affect cost of production, the price of the garment and improve the quality overall. 

- Lining: Coats, trousers, skirts will have an inner lining which adds warmth, thickness, comfort and increases durability. 

- Generous sizing: Whilst inconsistent sizing is a problem, cheaper clothing will just about hit the number if not slightly under on the brand's size chart. Generous sizing will be more accurate and have a bit “give” which can account for bloating, natural weight fluctuations, movement etc. which means less strain on the clothing. 


- Zips and buttons: In a similar vein, zips and buttons on dresses, skirts and trousers allow you to pull clothing over your body without straining fabric and still retaining a figure-hugging shape. Buttons last longer than zips and  zips come in a range of qualities too so I always reject items with a stiff zip.

- Seams: I’m not an expert on this but a simple test is to pull the fabric at the seams and see if it has room to stretch or whether it looks like it’s in danger of tearing. (More notes on seams in the resources below.)

- Tailoring: The more tailored an item is, the more likely it will keep its shape for longer.

*Bonus* Pattern matching: Different pieces of fabric stitched together will match at the seams and look better. 

**3. Don’t Buy Specialist Clothing from Non-Specialist Stores**

Unless you absolutely know that a fast fashion item is good quality, avoid buying something like a ski jacket or a pair of hiking boots from just anywhere. Often the reason why a store specialises in that item is because they are experts and there is technology behind it. As mentioned, materials matter and you want your technical fabrics - be the UV protecting, waterproofing, insulating - to be made by experts. In this case function is more important, fashion is a secondary factor. 

I personally consider shoes of any kind to be specialist (cobblers and tailors were historically separate professions for a reason). A few years ago, after my flat feet started complaining when I wore most of my shoes, I switched to exclusively buying from shoe brands. So far they have been more comfortable and longer lasting. It takes a lot of skill to make a good quality shoe and I just don’t think clothing brands make good quality shoes. Also if a good quality shoe wears away, you should be able to take it to a cobbler to be resoled (not had to use that option just yet so not sure how viable it is with high street shoes but definitely something to keep in mind). 

Side note: I appreciate that a lot of functional brands such as outdoorsy brands have not traditionally considered the fashion side and some still look like they haven’t changed their designs for 20 years ago BUT I think that’s changed a lot in recent years and you can get some gorgeous stuff at Passenger, Finisterre or The North Face that both looks good and is highly functional. 

**4. Laundry**

Gentle laundry is probably the top thing you can do for your clothes. Unless you are sweating through them or they are socks/underwear, you do not need to wash every item every time you wear it. The further something is away from direct contact with your skin, the less often it needs a wash. Spot clean if possible first (the corner of a towel works well for this).

*Washing* 

- Wash at a cooler temperature. Apart from bedding, towels and face masks that need a higher temperature to kill germs, I wash everything at 30°C.

- Avoid fabric softener. It’s not needed for most clothing but for activewear in particular it reduces the moisture wicking quality, traps sweat and reduces elasticity. 

- Wash your clothing inside out. Pilling happens as a result of friction when clothes rub against each other. This happens far more intensely in the washing machine than when you’re wearing them. Printed t-shirts will also retain their pattern longer and clothing with details like zips, beads or gems will stay secure and are less likely to damage other clothing if they are inside out.

- Do up zips, hook bras together and separate items into netted wash bags if they need a little bit of babying. Ideally wash bras by hand or on a delicate cycle to protect the cups and underwire.

*Drying*

There are valid reasons to not dry your clothes outside but if your excuse is laziness here’s your reminder that **heat from the dryer shortens the shelf life of your clothing**. I live in the UK and I will happily dry laundry outside between May to Octoberish and then I shift to using a dryer in the cooler seasons. I’ve also definitely taken advantage of working remotely and hanging clothes out to dry during the work day so sometimes it's just about stealing time here and there to accommodate it.

- You can partially dry things outside and then put them in the dryer to get the last bit of moisture out. Or vice versa, depending on the weather and what you’re drying.

- Some clothing, such as cotton and jersey fabrics, tend to dry more slowly so if you are using a tumble dryer, pull out lightweight clothing halfway so that they aren’t being blasted with heat for no reason.

- If you are in the position of buying a dryer, opt for one with settings for delicates and activewear.

Side note: I wouldn’t recommend drying all of your laundry on the radiator. All of that moisture has to go somewhere and if that place is your walls and ceiling, it is a guaranteed recipe for mould. 

*I don’t separate my darks/lights/coloured...*

because I mostly own synthetic clothing where the colour doesn’t bleed. Imagine my shock and disappointment when a secondhand cotton skirt bled a rust shade onto my white bamboo gym top. Lesson learnt - I now do a test run for new clothes and secondhand clothes and anything that bleeds will get a dedicated 15 minute cycle when it needs washing. 

**5. Learn How to Sew a Teensy Bit**

I’m not going to preach about the wonders of sewing your own clothes. I am not interested in sewing. I recently tried to hem a secondhand dress, with the guidance of my mother who is a very skilled seamstress. I spent over an hour hand stitching the hemline but somehow ruined the shape, despite my mum saying that my handiwork looked fine. So the problem is that sewing is hard and I am not invested enough in learning. ^(I will probably learn how to hem because most clothing is too long for me and I refuse to pay someone for a job I know I *could* do with a bit of practice but the point is sewing is a skill and I have no desire to *master* it.)

HOWEVER, I come from a culture where tailoring was the norm up until very recently and most women know how to sew in some capacity so I have picked up on some useful things. Basically my advice is to learn how to make tiny alterations that can keep clothing functional for a bit longer or slightly improve upon something that has been cheaply made, such as:

- Securing loose buttons (especially useful for coats)
- Sewing snap buttons for gapey tops 
- Stitching up loose seams when they come undone
- Securing straps on a top if you’re in danger of flashing a stranger the next time you wear it
- Removing extras you don’t like from clothing with a stitch picker

Avoid slub-knit cottons like the plague.  The weave is so thin, it tends to be see-through and it's prone to warping and getting holes. Cotton jersey is also often prone to pilling. 

Cotton-linen blends are usually used in higher quality weaves which are more durable and pill less. Rayon-linen blends are more common and are often used in lower quality fabrics which pill quickly.  Generally, the smoother and softer the linen blend is, the higher quality is it. Rougher and more open linen-blend weaves pill faster. 

OTOH, polyester is more durable and helps things keep shape and doesn't stain easily.  This can be really helpful in outerwear and pants, since they both get a lot of wear on the seat and under the arms/legs. 

Rayon is OK-ish. It's breathable, drapes nicely, but today it is used in many cheaper fabrics that can be prone to wrinkling, shrinking and fading. 

Wool-blend fabrics used in sweaters that have 3 or more materials seem to the most prone to pilling, at least in my experience."

I understand where this sentiment comes from but It's not all faux leather that is like this. My partner and I have multiple pairs of Doc Martens between us that have survived continuous wear, as well as multiple Toronto winters and they still look great.   
I have a Pixie Mood faux leather briefcase that is really well constructed and has stood the test of time.  
I had a Matt & Nat wallet that was great for 2 years before I donated it because I wanted a new style.   


This isn't to say that there isn't plenty of cheap shitty faux leather out there, cause there is! But I think this is like a lot of fabrics: it's not all created equal. Construction and type of faux leather play a huge role. There's some great stuff out there :)   
Side note: faux leather gets a lot (well-deserved IMO) hate for being plastic but this conversation often ignores the environmental impact of the tanning process of real leather, which includes a LOT of chemicals and leads to water pollution.   
I'm not particularly happy with either so am also excited for more eco-friendly leather alternatives like what you mentioned!    
Basically I think the best way to consume real leather is to buy secondhand. Because it's so durable it's easy to find at thrift stores and on second-hand websites. (I just can't personally do this because it gives me the heebie jeebies lmao, but I think this is a super good option for most people)"
femalefashionadvice,,A Guide to Making Your Fast Fashion Clothes Last Longer,"I often see people say here that their fast fashion clothes “fall apart” and I appreciate this is a bit of a hyperbolic statement but fast fashion these days *does* feel like a race to the bottom in terms of quality. Equally, buying more sustainable clothing is not an option for everyone. But one thing we can all do is try to buy better quality within our budget and take care of our clothes to ensure they last longer. Here are my top tips on how.

**1. Look at Labels/Descriptions**

The materials used to make your clothes matter a lot but the binary of natural fibres as good and synthetic fibres as bad is not accurate. Material science is a highly advanced field and both natural and man-made textiles come in high and low quality (yes, even polyester). Cheap fast fashion does tend to be on the lower end of the quality scale but there’s a reason why some of our fast fashion items may seemingly randomly last forever and why others don’t.

- Cheap cotton is still pretty decent. E.g. for basic tops or trousers if there is a price difference between two seemingly identical items of clothing, check the fabric. Sometimes it’s 50% cotton 50% polyester vs 100% cotton. Spend a bit more, get a bit more.

- Most knitwear eventually pills, but to avoid this and the inevitable use of a fabric shaver for a bit longer, avoid knitwear with too many textiles. The more textiles, the more likely the knit is going to pill and the same goes for looser knits. Most people will champion wool and cotton but in terms of synthetic fibres for those who are allergic (like me!), acrylic is a warm and cosy choice.

- For denim, look for a high cotton percentage. Obviously, this depends on how you like your jeans to feel (more cotton = stiffer) and the style (a skinny leg jeans need to have a bit of elastane/spandex) but heavyweight cotton jeans are less likely to wear away at points of friction (e.g. the thighs) and also less likely to lose their shape over time. I go for 100% cotton in looser styles and 95% cotton/5% elastane in skinny jeans. Cheaper brands will use a lighter weight of cotton compared to say, Levis, but they still tend to be sturdier. Equally don’t pay £100 for a pair of lightweight jeans, even if they’re 100% cotton. 

- Faux leather sucks. It’s plastic and it starts peeling within a few years, even when sitting unused in your wardrobe. I avoid it, especially in shoes and bags where real leather is affordable. Vegans, we’ll chat when [mycelium](https://www.mylo-unleather.com/) and [piñatex](https://www.ananas-anam.com/) are more common, affordable and have proven their longevity. Until then, leather is often a better quality option.
- Satin is not a fabric, it’s a weave and it could be made of silk, nylon or polyester so don’t be fooled.
- You’ll often find better basics in the men’s section. Same price point, higher quality materials. 
-  Sometimes a mixture of materials is a technical decision rather than a financial one so assess what the material is doing in the clothing. Elastane adds a bit of stretch, polyester can reduce wrinkles or increase durability, nylon can be moisture wicking. 

**2. Learn How to Spot Quality in Clothing**

A higher price doesn’t *always* denote better quality, but the following factors affect cost of production, the price of the garment and improve the quality overall. 

- Lining: Coats, trousers, skirts will have an inner lining which adds warmth, thickness, comfort and increases durability. 

- Generous sizing: Whilst inconsistent sizing is a problem, cheaper clothing will just about hit the number if not slightly under on the brand's size chart. Generous sizing will be more accurate and have a bit “give” which can account for bloating, natural weight fluctuations, movement etc. which means less strain on the clothing. 


- Zips and buttons: In a similar vein, zips and buttons on dresses, skirts and trousers allow you to pull clothing over your body without straining fabric and still retaining a figure-hugging shape. Buttons last longer than zips and  zips come in a range of qualities too so I always reject items with a stiff zip.

- Seams: I’m not an expert on this but a simple test is to pull the fabric at the seams and see if it has room to stretch or whether it looks like it’s in danger of tearing. (More notes on seams in the resources below.)

- Tailoring: The more tailored an item is, the more likely it will keep its shape for longer.

*Bonus* Pattern matching: Different pieces of fabric stitched together will match at the seams and look better. 

**3. Don’t Buy Specialist Clothing from Non-Specialist Stores**

Unless you absolutely know that a fast fashion item is good quality, avoid buying something like a ski jacket or a pair of hiking boots from just anywhere. Often the reason why a store specialises in that item is because they are experts and there is technology behind it. As mentioned, materials matter and you want your technical fabrics - be the UV protecting, waterproofing, insulating - to be made by experts. In this case function is more important, fashion is a secondary factor. 

I personally consider shoes of any kind to be specialist (cobblers and tailors were historically separate professions for a reason). A few years ago, after my flat feet started complaining when I wore most of my shoes, I switched to exclusively buying from shoe brands. So far they have been more comfortable and longer lasting. It takes a lot of skill to make a good quality shoe and I just don’t think clothing brands make good quality shoes. Also if a good quality shoe wears away, you should be able to take it to a cobbler to be resoled (not had to use that option just yet so not sure how viable it is with high street shoes but definitely something to keep in mind). 

Side note: I appreciate that a lot of functional brands such as outdoorsy brands have not traditionally considered the fashion side and some still look like they haven’t changed their designs for 20 years ago BUT I think that’s changed a lot in recent years and you can get some gorgeous stuff at Passenger, Finisterre or The North Face that both looks good and is highly functional. 

**4. Laundry**

Gentle laundry is probably the top thing you can do for your clothes. Unless you are sweating through them or they are socks/underwear, you do not need to wash every item every time you wear it. The further something is away from direct contact with your skin, the less often it needs a wash. Spot clean if possible first (the corner of a towel works well for this).

*Washing* 

- Wash at a cooler temperature. Apart from bedding, towels and face masks that need a higher temperature to kill germs, I wash everything at 30°C.

- Avoid fabric softener. It’s not needed for most clothing but for activewear in particular it reduces the moisture wicking quality, traps sweat and reduces elasticity. 

- Wash your clothing inside out. Pilling happens as a result of friction when clothes rub against each other. This happens far more intensely in the washing machine than when you’re wearing them. Printed t-shirts will also retain their pattern longer and clothing with details like zips, beads or gems will stay secure and are less likely to damage other clothing if they are inside out.

- Do up zips, hook bras together and separate items into netted wash bags if they need a little bit of babying. Ideally wash bras by hand or on a delicate cycle to protect the cups and underwire.

*Drying*

There are valid reasons to not dry your clothes outside but if your excuse is laziness here’s your reminder that **heat from the dryer shortens the shelf life of your clothing**. I live in the UK and I will happily dry laundry outside between May to Octoberish and then I shift to using a dryer in the cooler seasons. I’ve also definitely taken advantage of working remotely and hanging clothes out to dry during the work day so sometimes it's just about stealing time here and there to accommodate it.

- You can partially dry things outside and then put them in the dryer to get the last bit of moisture out. Or vice versa, depending on the weather and what you’re drying.

- Some clothing, such as cotton and jersey fabrics, tend to dry more slowly so if you are using a tumble dryer, pull out lightweight clothing halfway so that they aren’t being blasted with heat for no reason.

- If you are in the position of buying a dryer, opt for one with settings for delicates and activewear.

Side note: I wouldn’t recommend drying all of your laundry on the radiator. All of that moisture has to go somewhere and if that place is your walls and ceiling, it is a guaranteed recipe for mould. 

*I don’t separate my darks/lights/coloured...*

because I mostly own synthetic clothing where the colour doesn’t bleed. Imagine my shock and disappointment when a secondhand cotton skirt bled a rust shade onto my white bamboo gym top. Lesson learnt - I now do a test run for new clothes and secondhand clothes and anything that bleeds will get a dedicated 15 minute cycle when it needs washing. 

**5. Learn How to Sew a Teensy Bit**

I’m not going to preach about the wonders of sewing your own clothes. I am not interested in sewing. I recently tried to hem a secondhand dress, with the guidance of my mother who is a very skilled seamstress. I spent over an hour hand stitching the hemline but somehow ruined the shape, despite my mum saying that my handiwork looked fine. So the problem is that sewing is hard and I am not invested enough in learning. ^(I will probably learn how to hem because most clothing is too long for me and I refuse to pay someone for a job I know I *could* do with a bit of practice but the point is sewing is a skill and I have no desire to *master* it.)

HOWEVER, I come from a culture where tailoring was the norm up until very recently and most women know how to sew in some capacity so I have picked up on some useful things. Basically my advice is to learn how to make tiny alterations that can keep clothing functional for a bit longer or slightly improve upon something that has been cheaply made, such as:

- Securing loose buttons (especially useful for coats)
- Sewing snap buttons for gapey tops 
- Stitching up loose seams when they come undone
- Securing straps on a top if you’re in danger of flashing a stranger the next time you wear it
- Removing extras you don’t like from clothing with a stitch picker

Those are my big points on how to get the best out of your fast fashion though there are lots of little things you can do to take care of your clothes too. 

I really didn’t expect it to be this long but I'm trying to be a more ""conscious consumer"" - part of that is moving away from fast fashion but it’s difficult to do so completely. So when I do shop fast fashion, I’m trying to raise my standards for what I'm willing to buy from fast fashion and only go for items that are good enough quality to last a long time. 

I would also love to hear your tips and tricks!",2021,"Great post! I almost never have a problem with fast fashion falling apart, but I also do a lot of these things in terms of care. I will say, don't do up zippers, especially not for stuff going in the dryer\*. That will cause the fabric to move in a constrained way that makes the zipper go all wavy.  


\*I know in basically everywhere else in the world, air drying your laundry is common, but it's not in the US. I do hang or lay certain things out to dry like bras and sweaters and the occasional special garment, but in general, most of my stuff goes in the dryer."

- Zips and buttons: In a similar vein, zips and buttons on dresses, skirts and trousers allow you to pull clothing over your body without straining fabric and still retaining a figure-hugging shape. Buttons last longer than zips and  zips come in a range of qualities too so I always reject items with a stiff zip.

- Seams: I’m not an expert on this but a simple test is to pull the fabric at the seams and see if it has room to stretch or whether it looks like it’s in danger of tearing. (More notes on seams in the resources below.)

- Tailoring: The more tailored an item is, the more likely it will keep its shape for longer.

*Bonus* Pattern matching: Different pieces of fabric stitched together will match at the seams and look better. 

**3. Don’t Buy Specialist Clothing from Non-Specialist Stores**

Unless you absolutely know that a fast fashion item is good quality, avoid buying something like a ski jacket or a pair of hiking boots from just anywhere. Often the reason why a store specialises in that item is because they are experts and there is technology behind it. As mentioned, materials matter and you want your technical fabrics - be the UV protecting, waterproofing, insulating - to be made by experts. In this case function is more important, fashion is a secondary factor. 

I personally consider shoes of any kind to be specialist (cobblers and tailors were historically separate professions for a reason). A few years ago, after my flat feet started complaining when I wore most of my shoes, I switched to exclusively buying from shoe brands. So far they have been more comfortable and longer lasting. It takes a lot of skill to make a good quality shoe and I just don’t think clothing brands make good quality shoes. Also if a good quality shoe wears away, you should be able to take it to a cobbler to be resoled (not had to use that option just yet so not sure how viable it is with high street shoes but definitely something to keep in mind). 

Side note: I appreciate that a lot of functional brands such as outdoorsy brands have not traditionally considered the fashion side and some still look like they haven’t changed their designs for 20 years ago BUT I think that’s changed a lot in recent years and you can get some gorgeous stuff at Passenger, Finisterre or The North Face that both looks good and is highly functional. 

**4. Laundry**

Gentle laundry is probably the top thing you can do for your clothes. Unless you are sweating through them or they are socks/underwear, you do not need to wash every item every time you wear it. The further something is away from direct contact with your skin, the less often it needs a wash. Spot clean if possible first (the corner of a towel works well for this).

*Washing* 

- Wash at a cooler temperature. Apart from bedding, towels and face masks that need a higher temperature to kill germs, I wash everything at 30°C.

- Avoid fabric softener. It’s not needed for most clothing but for activewear in particular it reduces the moisture wicking quality, traps sweat and reduces elasticity. 

- Wash your clothing inside out. Pilling happens as a result of friction when clothes rub against each other. This happens far more intensely in the washing machine than when you’re wearing them. Printed t-shirts will also retain their pattern longer and clothing with details like zips, beads or gems will stay secure and are less likely to damage other clothing if they are inside out.

- Do up zips, hook bras together and separate items into netted wash bags if they need a little bit of babying. Ideally wash bras by hand or on a delicate cycle to protect the cups and underwire.

*Drying*

There are valid reasons to not dry your clothes outside but if your excuse is laziness here’s your reminder that **heat from the dryer shortens the shelf life of your clothing**. I live in the UK and I will happily dry laundry outside between May to Octoberish and then I shift to using a dryer in the cooler seasons. I’ve also definitely taken advantage of working remotely and hanging clothes out to dry during the work day so sometimes it's just about stealing time here and there to accommodate it.

- You can partially dry things outside and then put them in the dryer to get the last bit of moisture out. Or vice versa, depending on the weather and what you’re drying.

- Some clothing, such as cotton and jersey fabrics, tend to dry more slowly so if you are using a tumble dryer, pull out lightweight clothing halfway so that they aren’t being blasted with heat for no reason.

- If you are in the position of buying a dryer, opt for one with settings for delicates and activewear.

Side note: I wouldn’t recommend drying all of your laundry on the radiator. All of that moisture has to go somewhere and if that place is your walls and ceiling, it is a guaranteed recipe for mould. 

*I don’t separate my darks/lights/coloured...*

because I mostly own synthetic clothing where the colour doesn’t bleed. Imagine my shock and disappointment when a secondhand cotton skirt bled a rust shade onto my white bamboo gym top. Lesson learnt - I now do a test run for new clothes and secondhand clothes and anything that bleeds will get a dedicated 15 minute cycle when it needs washing. 

**5. Learn How to Sew a Teensy Bit**

I’m not going to preach about the wonders of sewing your own clothes. I am not interested in sewing. I recently tried to hem a secondhand dress, with the guidance of my mother who is a very skilled seamstress. I spent over an hour hand stitching the hemline but somehow ruined the shape, despite my mum saying that my handiwork looked fine. So the problem is that sewing is hard and I am not invested enough in learning. ^(I will probably learn how to hem because most clothing is too long for me and I refuse to pay someone for a job I know I *could* do with a bit of practice but the point is sewing is a skill and I have no desire to *master* it.)

HOWEVER, I come from a culture where tailoring was the norm up until very recently and most women know how to sew in some capacity so I have picked up on some useful things. Basically my advice is to learn how to make tiny alterations that can keep clothing functional for a bit longer or slightly improve upon something that has been cheaply made, such as:

- Securing loose buttons (especially useful for coats)
- Sewing snap buttons for gapey tops 
- Stitching up loose seams when they come undone
- Securing straps on a top if you’re in danger of flashing a stranger the next time you wear it
- Removing extras you don’t like from clothing with a stitch picker

Those are my big points on how to get the best out of your fast fashion though there are lots of little things you can do to take care of your clothes too. 

I really didn’t expect it to be this long but I'm trying to be a more ""conscious consumer"" - part of that is moving away from fast fashion but it’s difficult to do so completely. So when I do shop fast fashion, I’m trying to raise my standards for what I'm willing to buy from fast fashion and only go for items that are good enough quality to last a long time. 

I would also love to hear your tips and tricks!",2021,What is viscose anyway? I haven't read up on it at all and was surprised to find it the primary material in clothes from a sustainable cotton store. Cotton would not have my guess.
femalefashionadvice,,A Guide to Making Your Fast Fashion Clothes Last Longer,"I often see people say here that their fast fashion clothes “fall apart” and I appreciate this is a bit of a hyperbolic statement but fast fashion these days *does* feel like a race to the bottom in terms of quality. Equally, buying more sustainable clothing is not an option for everyone. But one thing we can all do is try to buy better quality within our budget and take care of our clothes to ensure they last longer. Here are my top tips on how.

**1. Look at Labels/Descriptions**

The materials used to make your clothes matter a lot but the binary of natural fibres as good and synthetic fibres as bad is not accurate. Material science is a highly advanced field and both natural and man-made textiles come in high and low quality (yes, even polyester). Cheap fast fashion does tend to be on the lower end of the quality scale but there’s a reason why some of our fast fashion items may seemingly randomly last forever and why others don’t.

- Cheap cotton is still pretty decent. E.g. for basic tops or trousers if there is a price difference between two seemingly identical items of clothing, check the fabric. Sometimes it’s 50% cotton 50% polyester vs 100% cotton. Spend a bit more, get a bit more.

- Most knitwear eventually pills, but to avoid this and the inevitable use of a fabric shaver for a bit longer, avoid knitwear with too many textiles. The more textiles, the more likely the knit is going to pill and the same goes for looser knits. Most people will champion wool and cotton but in terms of synthetic fibres for those who are allergic (like me!), acrylic is a warm and cosy choice.

- For denim, look for a high cotton percentage. Obviously, this depends on how you like your jeans to feel (more cotton = stiffer) and the style (a skinny leg jeans need to have a bit of elastane/spandex) but heavyweight cotton jeans are less likely to wear away at points of friction (e.g. the thighs) and also less likely to lose their shape over time. I go for 100% cotton in looser styles and 95% cotton/5% elastane in skinny jeans. Cheaper brands will use a lighter weight of cotton compared to say, Levis, but they still tend to be sturdier. Equally don’t pay £100 for a pair of lightweight jeans, even if they’re 100% cotton. 

- Faux leather sucks. It’s plastic and it starts peeling within a few years, even when sitting unused in your wardrobe. I avoid it, especially in shoes and bags where real leather is affordable. Vegans, we’ll chat when [mycelium](https://www.mylo-unleather.com/) and [piñatex](https://www.ananas-anam.com/) are more common, affordable and have proven their longevity. Until then, leather is often a better quality option.
- Satin is not a fabric, it’s a weave and it could be made of silk, nylon or polyester so don’t be fooled.
- You’ll often find better basics in the men’s section. Same price point, higher quality materials. 
-  Sometimes a mixture of materials is a technical decision rather than a financial one so assess what the material is doing in the clothing. Elastane adds a bit of stretch, polyester can reduce wrinkles or increase durability, nylon can be moisture wicking. 

**2. Learn How to Spot Quality in Clothing**

A higher price doesn’t *always* denote better quality, but the following factors affect cost of production, the price of the garment and improve the quality overall. 

- Lining: Coats, trousers, skirts will have an inner lining which adds warmth, thickness, comfort and increases durability. 

- Generous sizing: Whilst inconsistent sizing is a problem, cheaper clothing will just about hit the number if not slightly under on the brand's size chart. Generous sizing will be more accurate and have a bit “give” which can account for bloating, natural weight fluctuations, movement etc. which means less strain on the clothing. 


- Zips and buttons: In a similar vein, zips and buttons on dresses, skirts and trousers allow you to pull clothing over your body without straining fabric and still retaining a figure-hugging shape. Buttons last longer than zips and  zips come in a range of qualities too so I always reject items with a stiff zip.

- Tailoring: The more tailored an item is, the more likely it will keep its shape for longer.

*Bonus* Pattern matching: Different pieces of fabric stitched together will match at the seams and look better.

So the problem is that sewing is hard and I am not invested enough in learning. ^(I will probably learn how to hem because most clothing is too long for me and I refuse to pay someone for a job I know I *could* do with a bit of practice but the point is sewing is a skill and I have no desire to *master* it.)

HOWEVER, I come from a culture where tailoring was the norm up until very recently and most women know how to sew in some capacity so I have picked up on some useful things. Basically my advice is to learn how to make tiny alterations that can keep clothing functional for a bit longer or slightly improve upon something that has been cheaply made, such as:

- Securing loose buttons (especially useful for coats)
- Sewing snap buttons for gapey tops 
- Stitching up loose seams when they come undone
- Securing straps on a top if you’re in danger of flashing a stranger the next time you wear it
- Removing extras you don’t like from clothing with a stitch picker

Those are my big points on how to get the best out of your fast fashion though there are lots of little things you can do to take care of your clothes too. 

I really didn’t expect it to be this long but I'm trying to be a more ""conscious consumer"" - part of that is moving away from fast fashion but it’s difficult to do so completely. So when I do shop fast fashion, I’m trying to raise my standards for what I'm willing to buy from fast fashion and only go for items that are good enough quality to last a long time. 

I would also love to hear your tips and tricks!",2021,This whole thing should be saved to the wiki
femalefashionadvice,,A Guide to Making Your Fast Fashion Clothes Last Longer,"I often see people say here that their fast fashion clothes “fall apart” and I appreciate this is a bit of a hyperbolic statement but fast fashion these days *does* feel like a race to the bottom in terms of quality. Equally, buying more sustainable clothing is not an option for everyone. But one thing we can all do is try to buy better quality within our budget and take care of our clothes to ensure they last longer. Here are my top tips on how.

**1. Look at Labels/Descriptions**

The materials used to make your clothes matter a lot but the binary of natural fibres as good and synthetic fibres as bad is not accurate. Material science is a highly advanced field and both natural and man-made textiles come in high and low quality (yes, even polyester). Cheap fast fashion does tend to be on the lower end of the quality scale but there’s a reason why some of our fast fashion items may seemingly randomly last forever and why others don’t.

- Cheap cotton is still pretty decent. E.g. for basic tops or trousers if there is a price difference between two seemingly identical items of clothing, check the fabric. Sometimes it’s 50% cotton 50% polyester vs 100% cotton. Spend a bit more, get a bit more.

- Most knitwear eventually pills, but to avoid this and the inevitable use of a fabric shaver for a bit longer, avoid knitwear with too many textiles. The more textiles, the more likely the knit is going to pill and the same goes for looser knits. Most people will champion wool and cotton but in terms of synthetic fibres for those who are allergic (like me!), acrylic is a warm and cosy choice.

- For denim, look for a high cotton percentage. Obviously, this depends on how you like your jeans to feel (more cotton = stiffer) and the style (a skinny leg jeans need to have a bit of elastane/spandex) but heavyweight cotton jeans are less likely to wear away at points of friction (e.g. the thighs) and also less likely to lose their shape over time. I go for 100% cotton in looser styles and 95% cotton/5% elastane in skinny jeans. Cheaper brands will use a lighter weight of cotton compared to say, Levis, but they still tend to be sturdier. Equally don’t pay £100 for a pair of lightweight jeans, even if they’re 100% cotton. 

- Faux leather sucks. It’s plastic and it starts peeling within a few years, even when sitting unused in your wardrobe. I avoid it, especially in shoes and bags where real leather is affordable. Vegans, we’ll chat when [mycelium](https://www.mylo-unleather.com/) and [piñatex](https://www.ananas-anam.com/) are more common, affordable and have proven their longevity. Until then, leather is often a better quality option.
- Satin is not a fabric, it’s a weave and it could be made of silk, nylon or polyester so don’t be fooled.
- You’ll often find better basics in the men’s section. Same price point, higher quality materials. 
-  Sometimes a mixture of materials is a technical decision rather than a financial one so assess what the material is doing in the clothing. Elastane adds a bit of stretch, polyester can reduce wrinkles or increase durability, nylon can be moisture wicking. 

**2. Learn How to Spot Quality in Clothing**

A higher price doesn’t *always* denote better quality, but the following factors affect cost of production, the price of the garment and improve the quality overall. 

- Lining: Coats, trousers, skirts will have an inner lining which adds warmth, thickness, comfort and increases durability. 

- Generous sizing: Whilst inconsistent sizing is a problem, cheaper clothing will just about hit the number if not slightly under on the brand's size chart. Generous sizing will be more accurate and have a bit “give” which can account for bloating, natural weight fluctuations, movement etc. which means less strain on the clothing. 


- Zips and buttons: In a similar vein, zips and buttons on dresses, skirts and trousers allow you to pull clothing over your body without straining fabric and still retaining a figure-hugging shape. Buttons last longer than zips and  zips come in a range of qualities too so I always reject items with a stiff zip.

- Seams: I’m not an expert on this but a simple test is to pull the fabric at the seams and see if it has room to stretch or whether it looks like it’s in danger of tearing. (More notes on seams in the resources below.)

- Tailoring: The more tailored an item is, the more likely it will keep its shape for longer.

*Bonus* Pattern matching: Different pieces of fabric stitched together will match at the seams and look better. 

**3. Don’t Buy Specialist Clothing from Non-Specialist Stores**

Unless you absolutely know that a fast fashion item is good quality, avoid buying something like a ski jacket or a pair of hiking boots from just anywhere. Often the reason why a store specialises in that item is because they are experts and there is technology behind it. As mentioned, materials matter and you want your technical fabrics - be the UV protecting, waterproofing, insulating - to be made by experts. In this case function is more important, fashion is a secondary factor. 

I personally consider shoes of any kind to be specialist (cobblers and tailors were historically separate professions for a reason). A few years ago, after my flat feet started complaining when I wore most of my shoes, I switched to exclusively buying from shoe brands. So far they have been more comfortable and longer lasting. It takes a lot of skill to make a good quality shoe and I just don’t think clothing brands make good quality shoes. Also if a good quality shoe wears away, you should be able to take it to a cobbler to be resoled (not had to use that option just yet so not sure how viable it is with high street shoes but definitely something to keep in mind). 

Side note: I appreciate that a lot of functional brands such as outdoorsy brands have not traditionally considered the fashion side and some still look like they haven’t changed their designs for 20 years ago BUT I think that’s changed a lot in recent years and you can get some gorgeous stuff at Passenger, Finisterre or The North Face that both looks good and is highly functional. 

**4. Laundry**

Gentle laundry is probably the top thing you can do for your clothes. Unless you are sweating through them or they are socks/underwear, you do not need to wash every item every time you wear it. The further something is away from direct contact with your skin, the less often it needs a wash. Spot clean if possible first (the corner of a towel works well for this).

*Washing* 

- Wash at a cooler temperature. Apart from bedding, towels and face masks that need a higher temperature to kill germs, I wash everything at 30°C.

- Avoid fabric softener. It’s not needed for most clothing but for activewear in particular it reduces the moisture wicking quality, traps sweat and reduces elasticity. 

- Wash your clothing inside out. Pilling happens as a result of friction when clothes rub against each other. This happens far more intensely in the washing machine than when you’re wearing them. Printed t-shirts will also retain their pattern longer and clothing with details like zips, beads or gems will stay secure and are less likely to damage other clothing if they are inside out.

- Do up zips, hook bras together and separate items into netted wash bags if they need a little bit of babying. Ideally wash bras by hand or on a delicate cycle to protect the cups and underwire.

*Drying*

There are valid reasons to not dry your clothes outside but if your excuse is laziness here’s your reminder that **heat from the dryer shortens the shelf life of your clothing**. I live in the UK and I will happily dry laundry outside between May to Octoberish and then I shift to using a dryer in the cooler seasons. I’ve also definitely taken advantage of working remotely and hanging clothes out to dry during the work day so sometimes it's just about stealing time here and there to accommodate it.

- You can partially dry things outside and then put them in the dryer to get the last bit of moisture out. Or vice versa, depending on the weather and what you’re drying.

- Some clothing, such as cotton and jersey fabrics, tend to dry more slowly so if you are using a tumble dryer, pull out lightweight clothing halfway so that they aren’t being blasted with heat for no reason.

- If you are in the position of buying a dryer, opt for one with settings for delicates and activewear.

Side note: I wouldn’t recommend drying all of your laundry on the radiator. All of that moisture has to go somewhere and if that place is your walls and ceiling, it is a guaranteed recipe for mould. 

*I don’t separate my darks/lights/coloured...*

because I mostly own synthetic clothing where the colour doesn’t bleed. Imagine my shock and disappointment when a secondhand cotton skirt bled a rust shade onto my white bamboo gym top. Lesson learnt - I now do a test run for new clothes and secondhand clothes and anything that bleeds will get a dedicated 15 minute cycle when it needs washing. 

**5. Learn How to Sew a Teensy Bit**

I’m not going to preach about the wonders of sewing your own clothes. I am not interested in sewing. I recently tried to hem a secondhand dress, with the guidance of my mother who is a very skilled seamstress. I spent over an hour hand stitching the hemline but somehow ruined the shape, despite my mum saying that my handiwork looked fine. So the problem is that sewing is hard and I am not invested enough in learning. ^(I will probably learn how to hem because most clothing is too long for me and I refuse to pay someone for a job I know I *could* do with a bit of practice but the point is sewing is a skill and I have no desire to *master* it.)

It is a bit of a pain when I let them pile up but but otherwise it's made them last so much longer. And a lot of corporate clothes don't get much wear.

But one thing we can all do is try to buy better quality within our budget and take care of our clothes to ensure they last longer. Here are my top tips on how.

**1. Look at Labels/Descriptions**

The materials used to make your clothes matter a lot but the binary of natural fibres as good and synthetic fibres as bad is not accurate. Material science is a highly advanced field and both natural and man-made textiles come in high and low quality (yes, even polyester). Cheap fast fashion does tend to be on the lower end of the quality scale but there’s a reason why some of our fast fashion items may seemingly randomly last forever and why others don’t.

- Cheap cotton is still pretty decent. E.g. for basic tops or trousers if there is a price difference between two seemingly identical items of clothing, check the fabric. Sometimes it’s 50% cotton 50% polyester vs 100% cotton. Spend a bit more, get a bit more.

- Most knitwear eventually pills, but to avoid this and the inevitable use of a fabric shaver for a bit longer, avoid knitwear with too many textiles. The more textiles, the more likely the knit is going to pill and the same goes for looser knits. Most people will champion wool and cotton but in terms of synthetic fibres for those who are allergic (like me!), acrylic is a warm and cosy choice.

- For denim, look for a high cotton percentage. Obviously, this depends on how you like your jeans to feel (more cotton = stiffer) and the style (a skinny leg jeans need to have a bit of elastane/spandex) but heavyweight cotton jeans are less likely to wear away at points of friction (e.g. the thighs) and also less likely to lose their shape over time. I go for 100% cotton in looser styles and 95% cotton/5% elastane in skinny jeans. Cheaper brands will use a lighter weight of cotton compared to say, Levis, but they still tend to be sturdier. Equally don’t pay £100 for a pair of lightweight jeans, even if they’re 100% cotton. 

- Faux leather sucks. It’s plastic and it starts peeling within a few years, even when sitting unused in your wardrobe. I avoid it, especially in shoes and bags where real leather is affordable. Vegans, we’ll chat when [mycelium](https://www.mylo-unleather.com/) and [piñatex](https://www.ananas-anam.com/) are more common, affordable and have proven their longevity. Until then, leather is often a better quality option.
- Satin is not a fabric, it’s a weave and it could be made of silk, nylon or polyester so don’t be fooled.
- You’ll often find better basics in the men’s section. Same price point, higher quality materials. 
-  Sometimes a mixture of materials is a technical decision rather than a financial one so assess what the material is doing in the clothing. Elastane adds a bit of stretch, polyester can reduce wrinkles or increase durability, nylon can be moisture wicking. 

**2. Learn How to Spot Quality in Clothing**

A higher price doesn’t *always* denote better quality, but the following factors affect cost of production, the price of the garment and improve the quality overall. 

- Lining: Coats, trousers, skirts will have an inner lining which adds warmth, thickness, comfort and increases durability. 

- Generous sizing: Whilst inconsistent sizing is a problem, cheaper clothing will just about hit the number if not slightly under on the brand's size chart. Generous sizing will be more accurate and have a bit “give” which can account for bloating, natural weight fluctuations, movement etc. which means less strain on the clothing. 


- Zips and buttons: In a similar vein, zips and buttons on dresses, skirts and trousers allow you to pull clothing over your body without straining fabric and still retaining a figure-hugging shape. Buttons last longer than zips and  zips come in a range of qualities too so I always reject items with a stiff zip.

- Seams: I’m not an expert on this but a simple test is to pull the fabric at the seams and see if it has room to stretch or whether it looks like it’s in danger of tearing. (More notes on seams in the resources below.)

- Tailoring: The more tailored an item is, the more likely it will keep its shape for longer.

*Bonus* Pattern matching: Different pieces of fabric stitched together will match at the seams and look better. 

**3. Don’t Buy Specialist Clothing from Non-Specialist Stores**

Unless you absolutely know that a fast fashion item is good quality, avoid buying something like a ski jacket or a pair of hiking boots from just anywhere. Often the reason why a store specialises in that item is because they are experts and there is technology behind it. As mentioned, materials matter and you want your technical fabrics - be the UV protecting, waterproofing, insulating - to be made by experts. In this case function is more important, fashion is a secondary factor. 

I personally consider shoes of any kind to be specialist (cobblers and tailors were historically separate professions for a reason). A few years ago, after my flat feet started complaining when I wore most of my shoes, I switched to exclusively buying from shoe brands. So far they have been more comfortable and longer lasting. It takes a lot of skill to make a good quality shoe and I just don’t think clothing brands make good quality shoes. Also if a good quality shoe wears away, you should be able to take it to a cobbler to be resoled (not had to use that option just yet so not sure how viable it is with high street shoes but definitely something to keep in mind). 

Side note: I appreciate that a lot of functional brands such as outdoorsy brands have not traditionally considered the fashion side and some still look like they haven’t changed their designs for 20 years ago BUT I think that’s changed a lot in recent years and you can get some gorgeous stuff at Passenger, Finisterre or The North Face that both looks good and is highly functional. 

**4. Laundry**

Gentle laundry is probably the top thing you can do for your clothes. Unless you are sweating through them or they are socks/underwear, you do not need to wash every item every time you wear it. The further something is away from direct contact with your skin, the less often it needs a wash. Spot clean if possible first (the corner of a towel works well for this).

*Washing* 

- Wash at a cooler temperature. Apart from bedding, towels and face masks that need a higher temperature to kill germs, I wash everything at 30°C.

- Avoid fabric softener. It’s not needed for most clothing but for activewear in particular it reduces the moisture wicking quality, traps sweat and reduces elasticity. 

- Wash your clothing inside out. Pilling happens as a result of friction when clothes rub against each other. This happens far more intensely in the washing machine than when you’re wearing them. Printed t-shirts will also retain their pattern longer and clothing with details like zips, beads or gems will stay secure and are less likely to damage other clothing if they are inside out.

- Do up zips, hook bras together and separate items into netted wash bags if they need a little bit of babying. Ideally wash bras by hand or on a delicate cycle to protect the cups and underwire.

*Drying*

There are valid reasons to not dry your clothes outside but if your excuse is laziness here’s your reminder that **heat from the dryer shortens the shelf life of your clothing**. I live in the UK and I will happily dry laundry outside between May to Octoberish and then I shift to using a dryer in the cooler seasons. I’ve also definitely taken advantage of working remotely and hanging clothes out to dry during the work day so sometimes it's just about stealing time here and there to accommodate it.

- You can partially dry things outside and then put them in the dryer to get the last bit of moisture out. Or vice versa, depending on the weather and what you’re drying.

- Some clothing, such as cotton and jersey fabrics, tend to dry more slowly so if you are using a tumble dryer, pull out lightweight clothing halfway so that they aren’t being blasted with heat for no reason.

- If you are in the position of buying a dryer, opt for one with settings for delicates and activewear.

Side note: I wouldn’t recommend drying all of your laundry on the radiator. All of that moisture has to go somewhere and if that place is your walls and ceiling, it is a guaranteed recipe for mould. 

*I don’t separate my darks/lights/coloured...*

because I mostly own synthetic clothing where the colour doesn’t bleed. Imagine my shock and disappointment when a secondhand cotton skirt bled a rust shade onto my white bamboo gym top. Lesson learnt - I now do a test run for new clothes and secondhand clothes and anything that bleeds will get a dedicated 15 minute cycle when it needs washing. 

**5. Learn How to Sew a Teensy Bit**

I’m not going to preach about the wonders of sewing your own clothes. I am not interested in sewing. I recently tried to hem a secondhand dress, with the guidance of my mother who is a very skilled seamstress. I spent over an hour hand stitching the hemline but somehow ruined the shape, despite my mum saying that my handiwork looked fine. So the problem is that sewing is hard and I am not invested enough in learning. ^(I will probably learn how to hem because most clothing is too long for me and I refuse to pay someone for a job I know I *could* do with a bit of practice but the point is sewing is a skill and I have no desire to *master* it.)

HOWEVER, I come from a culture where tailoring was the norm up until very recently and most women know how to sew in some capacity so I have picked up on some useful things. Basically my advice is to learn how to make tiny alterations that can keep clothing functional for a bit longer or slightly improve upon something that has been cheaply made, such as:

- Securing loose buttons (especially useful for coats)
- Sewing snap buttons for gapey tops 
- Stitching up loose seams when they come undone
- Securing straps on a top if you’re in danger of flashing a stranger the next time you wear it
- Removing extras you don’t like from clothing with a stitch picker

Those are my big points on how to get the best out of your fast fashion though there are lots of little things you can do to take care of your clothes too. 

I really didn’t expect it to be this long but I'm trying to be a more ""conscious consumer"" - part of that is moving away from fast fashion but it’s difficult to do so completely. So when I do shop fast fashion, I’m trying to raise my standards for what I'm willing to buy from fast fashion and only go for items that are good enough quality to last a long time. 

I would also love to hear your tips and tricks!",2021,"Yes! These are basically all the rules I already live by, compiled into one post. My wardrobe includes plenty of “cheap” but decent quality things I’ve treated still like investments, and some are still going strong over a decade later."

Also if a good quality shoe wears away, you should be able to take it to a cobbler to be resoled (not had to use that option just yet so not sure how viable it is with high street shoes but definitely something to keep in mind). 

Side note: I appreciate that a lot of functional brands such as outdoorsy brands have not traditionally considered the fashion side and some still look like they haven’t changed their designs for 20 years ago BUT I think that’s changed a lot in recent years and you can get some gorgeous stuff at Passenger, Finisterre or The North Face that both looks good and is highly functional. 

**4. Laundry**

Gentle laundry is probably the top thing you can do for your clothes. Unless you are sweating through them or they are socks/underwear, you do not need to wash every item every time you wear it. The further something is away from direct contact with your skin, the less often it needs a wash. Spot clean if possible first (the corner of a towel works well for this).

*Washing* 

- Wash at a cooler temperature. Apart from bedding, towels and face masks that need a higher temperature to kill germs, I wash everything at 30°C.

- Avoid fabric softener. It’s not needed for most clothing but for activewear in particular it reduces the moisture wicking quality, traps sweat and reduces elasticity. 

- Wash your clothing inside out. Pilling happens as a result of friction when clothes rub against each other. This happens far more intensely in the washing machine than when you’re wearing them. Printed t-shirts will also retain their pattern longer and clothing with details like zips, beads or gems will stay secure and are less likely to damage other clothing if they are inside out.

- Do up zips, hook bras together and separate items into netted wash bags if they need a little bit of babying. Ideally wash bras by hand or on a delicate cycle to protect the cups and underwire.

*Drying*

There are valid reasons to not dry your clothes outside but if your excuse is laziness here’s your reminder that **heat from the dryer shortens the shelf life of your clothing**. I live in the UK and I will happily dry laundry outside between May to Octoberish and then I shift to using a dryer in the cooler seasons. I’ve also definitely taken advantage of working remotely and hanging clothes out to dry during the work day so sometimes it's just about stealing time here and there to accommodate it.

- You can partially dry things outside and then put them in the dryer to get the last bit of moisture out. Or vice versa, depending on the weather and what you’re drying.

- Some clothing, such as cotton and jersey fabrics, tend to dry more slowly so if you are using a tumble dryer, pull out lightweight clothing halfway so that they aren’t being blasted with heat for no reason.

- If you are in the position of buying a dryer, opt for one with settings for delicates and activewear.

Side note: I wouldn’t recommend drying all of your laundry on the radiator. All of that moisture has to go somewhere and if that place is your walls and ceiling, it is a guaranteed recipe for mould. 

*I don’t separate my darks/lights/coloured...*

because I mostly own synthetic clothing where the colour doesn’t bleed. Imagine my shock and disappointment when a secondhand cotton skirt bled a rust shade onto my white bamboo gym top. Lesson learnt - I now do a test run for new clothes and secondhand clothes and anything that bleeds will get a dedicated 15 minute cycle when it needs washing. 

**5. Learn How to Sew a Teensy Bit**

I’m not going to preach about the wonders of sewing your own clothes. I am not interested in sewing. I recently tried to hem a secondhand dress, with the guidance of my mother who is a very skilled seamstress. I spent over an hour hand stitching the hemline but somehow ruined the shape, despite my mum saying that my handiwork looked fine. So the problem is that sewing is hard and I am not invested enough in learning. ^(I will probably learn how to hem because most clothing is too long for me and I refuse to pay someone for a job I know I *could* do with a bit of practice but the point is sewing is a skill and I have no desire to *master* it.)

HOWEVER, I come from a culture where tailoring was the norm up until very recently and most women know how to sew in some capacity so I have picked up on some useful things. Basically my advice is to learn how to make tiny alterations that can keep clothing functional for a bit longer or slightly improve upon something that has been cheaply made, such as:

- Securing loose buttons (especially useful for coats)
- Sewing snap buttons for gapey tops 
- Stitching up loose seams when they come undone
- Securing straps on a top if you’re in danger of flashing a stranger the next time you wear it
- Removing extras you don’t like from clothing with a stitch picker

Those are my big points on how to get the best out of your fast fashion though there are lots of little things you can do to take care of your clothes too. 

I really didn’t expect it to be this long but I'm trying to be a more ""conscious consumer"" - part of that is moving away from fast fashion but it’s difficult to do so completely. So when I do shop fast fashion, I’m trying to raise my standards for what I'm willing to buy from fast fashion and only go for items that are good enough quality to last a long time. 

I would also love to hear your tips and tricks!",2021,This is a great guide!  I’ve been looking into how to make my clothes last longer as well.
femalefashionadvice,,A Guide to Making Your Fast Fashion Clothes Last Longer,"I often see people say here that their fast fashion clothes “fall apart” and I appreciate this is a bit of a hyperbolic statement but fast fashion these days *does* feel like a race to the bottom in terms of quality. Equally, buying more sustainable clothing is not an option for everyone. But one thing we can all do is try to buy better quality within our budget and take care of our clothes to ensure they last longer. Here are my top tips on how.

**1. Look at Labels/Descriptions**

The materials used to make your clothes matter a lot but the binary of natural fibres as good and synthetic fibres as bad is not accurate. Material science is a highly advanced field and both natural and man-made textiles come in high and low quality (yes, even polyester). Cheap fast fashion does tend to be on the lower end of the quality scale but there’s a reason why some of our fast fashion items may seemingly randomly last forever and why others don’t.

- Cheap cotton is still pretty decent. E.g. for basic tops or trousers if there is a price difference between two seemingly identical items of clothing, check the fabric. Sometimes it’s 50% cotton 50% polyester vs 100% cotton. Spend a bit more, get a bit more.

- Most knitwear eventually pills, but to avoid this and the inevitable use of a fabric shaver for a bit longer, avoid knitwear with too many textiles. The more textiles, the more likely the knit is going to pill and the same goes for looser knits. Most people will champion wool and cotton but in terms of synthetic fibres for those who are allergic (like me!), acrylic is a warm and cosy choice.

- For denim, look for a high cotton percentage. Obviously, this depends on how you like your jeans to feel (more cotton = stiffer) and the style (a skinny leg jeans need to have a bit of elastane/spandex) but heavyweight cotton jeans are less likely to wear away at points of friction (e.g. the thighs) and also less likely to lose their shape over time. I go for 100% cotton in looser styles and 95% cotton/5% elastane in skinny jeans. Cheaper brands will use a lighter weight of cotton compared to say, Levis, but they still tend to be sturdier. Equally don’t pay £100 for a pair of lightweight jeans, even if they’re 100% cotton. 

- Faux leather sucks. It’s plastic and it starts peeling within a few years, even when sitting unused in your wardrobe. I avoid it, especially in shoes and bags where real leather is affordable. Vegans, we’ll chat when [mycelium](https://www.mylo-unleather.com/) and [piñatex](https://www.ananas-anam.com/) are more common, affordable and have proven their longevity. Until then, leather is often a better quality option.
- Satin is not a fabric, it’s a weave and it could be made of silk, nylon or polyester so don’t be fooled.
- You’ll often find better basics in the men’s section. Same price point, higher quality materials. 
-  Sometimes a mixture of materials is a technical decision rather than a financial one so assess what the material is doing in the clothing. Elastane adds a bit of stretch, polyester can reduce wrinkles or increase durability, nylon can be moisture wicking. 

**2. Learn How to Spot Quality in Clothing**

A higher price doesn’t *always* denote better quality, but the following factors affect cost of production, the price of the garment and improve the quality overall. 

- Lining: Coats, trousers, skirts will have an inner lining which adds warmth, thickness, comfort and increases durability. 

- Generous sizing: Whilst inconsistent sizing is a problem, cheaper clothing will just about hit the number if not slightly under on the brand's size chart. Generous sizing will be more accurate and have a bit “give” which can account for bloating, natural weight fluctuations, movement etc. which means less strain on the clothing. 


- Zips and buttons: In a similar vein, zips and buttons on dresses, skirts and trousers allow you to pull clothing over your body without straining fabric and still retaining a figure-hugging shape. Buttons last longer than zips and  zips come in a range of qualities too so I always reject items with a stiff zip.

- Seams: I’m not an expert on this but a simple test is to pull the fabric at the seams and see if it has room to stretch or whether it looks like it’s in danger of tearing. (More notes on seams in the resources below.)

- Tailoring: The more tailored an item is, the more likely it will keep its shape for longer.

*Bonus* Pattern matching: Different pieces of fabric stitched together will match at the seams and look better. 

**3. Don’t Buy Specialist Clothing from Non-Specialist Stores**

Unless you absolutely know that a fast fashion item is good quality, avoid buying something like a ski jacket or a pair of hiking boots from just anywhere. Often the reason why a store specialises in that item is because they are experts and there is technology behind it. As mentioned, materials matter and you want your technical fabrics - be the UV protecting, waterproofing, insulating - to be made by experts. In this case function is more important, fashion is a secondary factor. 

I personally consider shoes of any kind to be specialist (cobblers and tailors were historically separate professions for a reason). A few years ago, after my flat feet started complaining when I wore most of my shoes, I switched to exclusively buying from shoe brands. So far they have been more comfortable and longer lasting. It takes a lot of skill to make a good quality shoe and I just don’t think clothing brands make good quality shoes. Also if a good quality shoe wears away, you should be able to take it to a cobbler to be resoled (not had to use that option just yet so not sure how viable it is with high street shoes but definitely something to keep in mind).

[How to care for clothes + 6 laundry hacks | Justine Leconte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtmB2A5Fkf4)

Those are my big points on how to get the best out of your fast fashion though there are lots of little things you can do to take care of your clothes too. 

I really didn’t expect it to be this long but I'm trying to be a more ""conscious consumer"" - part of that is moving away from fast fashion but it’s difficult to do so completely. So when I do shop fast fashion, I’m trying to raise my standards for what I'm willing to buy from fast fashion and only go for items that are good enough quality to last a long time. 

I would also love to hear your tips and tricks!",2021,"""Most knitwear eventually pills, but to avoid this and the inevitable use of a fabric shaver for a bit longer, avoid knitwear with too many textiles. The more textiles, the more likely the knit is going to pill and the same goes for looser knits. Most people will champion wool and cotton but in terms of synthetic fibres for those who are allergic (like me!), acrylic is a warm and cosy choice.""

This is such a basic question but what is a textile in terms of knitware?? Or maybe more specifically my question is what is an example of non-textile knitware?"
femalefashionadvice,,A Guide to Making Your Fast Fashion Clothes Last Longer,"I often see people say here that their fast fashion clothes “fall apart” and I appreciate this is a bit of a hyperbolic statement but fast fashion these days *does* feel like a race to the bottom in terms of quality. Equally, buying more sustainable clothing is not an option for everyone. But one thing we can all do is try to buy better quality within our budget and take care of our clothes to ensure they last longer. Here are my top tips on how.

**1. Look at Labels/Descriptions**

The materials used to make your clothes matter a lot but the binary of natural fibres as good and synthetic fibres as bad is not accurate. Material science is a highly advanced field and both natural and man-made textiles come in high and low quality (yes, even polyester). Cheap fast fashion does tend to be on the lower end of the quality scale but there’s a reason why some of our fast fashion items may seemingly randomly last forever and why others don’t.

- Cheap cotton is still pretty decent. E.g. for basic tops or trousers if there is a price difference between two seemingly identical items of clothing, check the fabric. Sometimes it’s 50% cotton 50% polyester vs 100% cotton. Spend a bit more, get a bit more.

- Most knitwear eventually pills, but to avoid this and the inevitable use of a fabric shaver for a bit longer, avoid knitwear with too many textiles. The more textiles, the more likely the knit is going to pill and the same goes for looser knits. Most people will champion wool and cotton but in terms of synthetic fibres for those who are allergic (like me!), acrylic is a warm and cosy choice.

- For denim, look for a high cotton percentage. Obviously, this depends on how you like your jeans to feel (more cotton = stiffer) and the style (a skinny leg jeans need to have a bit of elastane/spandex) but heavyweight cotton jeans are less likely to wear away at points of friction (e.g. the thighs) and also less likely to lose their shape over time. I go for 100% cotton in looser styles and 95% cotton/5% elastane in skinny jeans. Cheaper brands will use a lighter weight of cotton compared to say, Levis, but they still tend to be sturdier. Equally don’t pay £100 for a pair of lightweight jeans, even if they’re 100% cotton. 

- Faux leather sucks. It’s plastic and it starts peeling within a few years, even when sitting unused in your wardrobe. I avoid it, especially in shoes and bags where real leather is affordable. Vegans, we’ll chat when [mycelium](https://www.mylo-unleather.com/) and [piñatex](https://www.ananas-anam.com/) are more common, affordable and have proven their longevity. Until then, leather is often a better quality option.
- Satin is not a fabric, it’s a weave and it could be made of silk, nylon or polyester so don’t be fooled.
- You’ll often find better basics in the men’s section. Same price point, higher quality materials. 
-  Sometimes a mixture of materials is a technical decision rather than a financial one so assess what the material is doing in the clothing. Elastane adds a bit of stretch, polyester can reduce wrinkles or increase durability, nylon can be moisture wicking. 

**2. Learn How to Spot Quality in Clothing**

A higher price doesn’t *always* denote better quality, but the following factors affect cost of production, the price of the garment and improve the quality overall. 

- Lining: Coats, trousers, skirts will have an inner lining which adds warmth, thickness, comfort and increases durability. 

- Generous sizing: Whilst inconsistent sizing is a problem, cheaper clothing will just about hit the number if not slightly under on the brand's size chart. Generous sizing will be more accurate and have a bit “give” which can account for bloating, natural weight fluctuations, movement etc. which means less strain on the clothing. 


- Zips and buttons: In a similar vein, zips and buttons on dresses, skirts and trousers allow you to pull clothing over your body without straining fabric and still retaining a figure-hugging shape. Buttons last longer than zips and  zips come in a range of qualities too so I always reject items with a stiff zip.

- Seams: I’m not an expert on this but a simple test is to pull the fabric at the seams and see if it has room to stretch or whether it looks like it’s in danger of tearing. (More notes on seams in the resources below.)

- Tailoring: The more tailored an item is, the more likely it will keep its shape for longer.

*Bonus* Pattern matching: Different pieces of fabric stitched together will match at the seams and look better. 

**3. Don’t Buy Specialist Clothing from Non-Specialist Stores**

Unless you absolutely know that a fast fashion item is good quality, avoid buying something like a ski jacket or a pair of hiking boots from just anywhere. Often the reason why a store specialises in that item is because they are experts and there is technology behind it. As mentioned, materials matter and you want your technical fabrics - be the UV protecting, waterproofing, insulating - to be made by experts. In this case function is more important, fashion is a secondary factor. 

I personally consider shoes of any kind to be specialist (cobblers and tailors were historically separate professions for a reason). A few years ago, after my flat feet started complaining when I wore most of my shoes, I switched to exclusively buying from shoe brands. So far they have been more comfortable and longer lasting. It takes a lot of skill to make a good quality shoe and I just don’t think clothing brands make good quality shoes. Also if a good quality shoe wears away, you should be able to take it to a cobbler to be resoled (not had to use that option just yet so not sure how viable it is with high street shoes but definitely something to keep in mind). 

Side note: I appreciate that a lot of functional brands such as outdoorsy brands have not traditionally considered the fashion side and some still look like they haven’t changed their designs for 20 years ago BUT I think that’s changed a lot in recent years and you can get some gorgeous stuff at Passenger, Finisterre or The North Face that both looks good and is highly functional. 

**4. Laundry**

Gentle laundry is probably the top thing you can do for your clothes. Unless you are sweating through them or they are socks/underwear, you do not need to wash every item every time you wear it. The further something is away from direct contact with your skin, the less often it needs a wash. Spot clean if possible first (the corner of a towel works well for this).

*Washing* 

- Wash at a cooler temperature. Apart from bedding, towels and face masks that need a higher temperature to kill germs, I wash everything at 30°C.

- Avoid fabric softener. It’s not needed for most clothing but for activewear in particular it reduces the moisture wicking quality, traps sweat and reduces elasticity. 

- Wash your clothing inside out. Pilling happens as a result of friction when clothes rub against each other. This happens far more intensely in the washing machine than when you’re wearing them. Printed t-shirts will also retain their pattern longer and clothing with details like zips, beads or gems will stay secure and are less likely to damage other clothing if they are inside out.

- Do up zips, hook bras together and separate items into netted wash bags if they need a little bit of babying. Ideally wash bras by hand or on a delicate cycle to protect the cups and underwire.

*Drying*

There are valid reasons to not dry your clothes outside but if your excuse is laziness here’s your reminder that **heat from the dryer shortens the shelf life of your clothing**. I live in the UK and I will happily dry laundry outside between May to Octoberish and then I shift to using a dryer in the cooler seasons. I’ve also definitely taken advantage of working remotely and hanging clothes out to dry during the work day so sometimes it's just about stealing time here and there to accommodate it.

- You can partially dry things outside and then put them in the dryer to get the last bit of moisture out. Or vice versa, depending on the weather and what you’re drying.

- Some clothing, such as cotton and jersey fabrics, tend to dry more slowly so if you are using a tumble dryer, pull out lightweight clothing halfway so that they aren’t being blasted with heat for no reason.

- If you are in the position of buying a dryer, opt for one with settings for delicates and activewear.

Side note: I wouldn’t recommend drying all of your laundry on the radiator. All of that moisture has to go somewhere and if that place is your walls and ceiling, it is a guaranteed recipe for mould. 

*I don’t separate my darks/lights/coloured...*

because I mostly own synthetic clothing where the colour doesn’t bleed. Imagine my shock and disappointment when a secondhand cotton skirt bled a rust shade onto my white bamboo gym top. Lesson learnt - I now do a test run for new clothes and secondhand clothes and anything that bleeds will get a dedicated 15 minute cycle when it needs washing. 

**5. Learn How to Sew a Teensy Bit**

I’m not going to preach about the wonders of sewing your own clothes. I am not interested in sewing. I recently tried to hem a secondhand dress, with the guidance of my mother who is a very skilled seamstress. I spent over an hour hand stitching the hemline but somehow ruined the shape, despite my mum saying that my handiwork looked fine. So the problem is that sewing is hard and I am not invested enough in learning. ^(I will probably learn how to hem because most clothing is too long for me and I refuse to pay someone for a job I know I *could* do with a bit of practice but the point is sewing is a skill and I have no desire to *master* it.)

HOWEVER, I come from a culture where tailoring was the norm up until very recently and most women know how to sew in some capacity so I have picked up on some useful things. Basically my advice is to learn how to make tiny alterations that can keep clothing functional for a bit longer or slightly improve upon something that has been cheaply made, such as:

- Securing loose buttons (especially useful for coats)
- Sewing snap buttons for gapey tops 
- Stitching up loose seams when they come undone
- Securing straps on a top if you’re in danger of flashing a stranger the next time you wear it
- Removing extras you don’t like from clothing with a stitch picker

At the moment Pre-Loved/second hand is the most trusted sustainable way of shopping and supper affordable saving you hundreds of $$$."
FrugalFemaleFashion,Discussion ,When did fast fashion get expensive?,"The whole spiel about fast fashion is that it’s cheap to make, cheap to buy. Now, I’m seeing online shops with 700+ products sell tops at a minimum of $50 USD.

These people really have no morals.",2021,"I’m glad this is sparking up conversation, and I’d like to take the time to bring attention to responsible clothing vendors! (It’s a cause I advocate strongly for) 

goodonyou.eco is a directory for environmentally and ethically sustainable fashion brands that does research and provides detailed reports on the actions of the company! You can filter brands by price and search up specific clothing pieces. 

Also, nu-in is one of those brands that creates genuinely trendy pieces (bc honestly cute and ethical clothes are hard to find) at LESS than many of those fast fashion prices! 

Not affiliated with these, just care and want to reduce the amount of research y’all need to do :))"

The responsiveness of the supply chain is what allows you to get access to the “trend” that’s currently on the runway that costs thousands, for a fraction (like 10-20%) of the cost.  These trends wouldn’t usually hit the mass market (Gap, Jcrew, Express, Target) for months or years, so this was a novel alternative that allowed fashionistas to wear a version of what they saw in Vogue a month after it came out, paying $100 not $1000.  As mass apparel moves to try to have a more responsive supply chain, you see a degradation of quality as the supply chain struggles to economically produce a volume that the designers brands don’t, at a speed that becomes incrementally more"

That why usually designer garment can be very expensive since it is not really from factory or mass production. These items usually are in smaller quantity, so the price need to spread out for revenue. Plus there is a lot of thought on design, went through many concept before get into production. I personally think the hoodie is not that ugly, but I do think the price is ridiculous for the designer label that not that famous."

ethicalfashion,,Is Uniqlo a fast fashion?,I am a big fan of Uniqlo but wonder should I keep buy their products.,2023,"It is fast fashion, but that doesn't mean you have to avoid it entirely. Uniqlo is pretty good quality, and they have a lot of basics that won't go out of style. So if you buy something from Uniqlo, just make an effort to wear it for a long time and take care of it! I have a few really sturdy flannel shirts from there that I've had for years, I even did a bit of mending on one. Especially if it's the right price point for you, go ahead and wear it. As long as you're not cycling out each thing you buy there every season, I think it's not so bad."

For a quicker answer, it’s yes. For big high street brands, it’s almost always yes."
ethicalfashion,,Is Uniqlo a fast fashion?,I am a big fan of Uniqlo but wonder should I keep buy their products.,2023,"It’s fast fashion but not bad quality and they have a lot basics, so if you don’t buy lots and wear it often enough, you shouldn’t stress about it too much."
ethicalfashion,,Is Uniqlo a fast fashion?,I am a big fan of Uniqlo but wonder should I keep buy their products.,2023,"If I need new basics and can't find things thrifting etc I usually will buy from Uniqlo as the basics usually are high enough quality that I will get years of wear out of it if I take care of them. 

Some people will disagree with me but my personal opinion is that if you buy new pieces *and wear them,* there's not really as much of an issue. From a sustainability perspective, it's better to buy used - but if you are buying new, use it for its whole life. 

From a workers rights point of view, it's not great. But I am unfortunately priced out of more ethical options, and because my sizing can sometimes be really difficult to find, I don't have that many options when I wear through my old pieces."

I would say 90% of the stuff I see in thrift stores isn’t “vintage”, it’s all stuff from 2000-present. From that alone you could say fast fashion is fueling thrift stores as that is most of their stock. It’s very rare that I see something from a price point higher than moderate. 

But the influence fast fashion has on attitudes toward clothing has had a greater impact. When clothes rip, we throw them away. When they go out of trend we get ride of them. People view clothes as disposable now. That attitude probably creeps up into clothes that aren’t fast fashion to begin with, and they’ll get donated the same way as if they were from h&m.

You won’t see ripped clothes in the thrift stores because the store won’t accept them anymore. If it’s faulty, it’s viewed as trash now. By the store and by the customer. 

So I agree that fast fashion makes thrifting more popular, but only because it’s speeding up the life cycle of a garment significantly."

You can find quality Canadian brands if you look and do some research. These are brands MADE in Canada not of Canadian origin like ecologist, encircled, free label, buttercream clothing, rudsak, muttonhead, province of Canada etc

Be careful of green washing and ethic washing by brands who are “middle of the road”.

So the biggest determinant is where clothes are made and once you start paying wages appropriately…cost goes up a lot. 

Your situation is a bit different where you need a specific item for a specific thing that may not be permanent. This is where fast fashion kinda makes sense. When you get a role that needs this daily then you invest overtime in things that last. 

For me, the place to focus my money is on stuff I use regularly. Jeans I get from Naked and Famous. Shirts I get from Canadian sources. Anian, common manufacturing, ecologyst. Yes these are $$$. But I have 2 pairs of jeans in my rotation, and about 5 shirts. I have a bunch of free t shirts that I wear around the house, some sporty shorts that are lululemon…kinda fast fashion but will last me 5+ years.  

So the best way to reduce your reliance on fast fashion is to just buy fewer clothes. And the ones you do buy seek quality and ethical manufacturing."

They get a lot of Aritzia stuff and it just so happens they're having an Aritzia drop this weekend. I'm signed up for their notifications so I got a message today. I don't need anything so I won't be going but if you go the trick is to look at the clothing tags and only get the stuff that's made from good material so cotton, linen, wool, silk if you're lucky. Don't get any blends or fake material. I've found a LOT of great Aritzia clothing for a fraction of Aritzia prices, like a Babaton skirt for maybe 25 bucks? This was pre-pandemic though I haven't gone in a long time so idk what their prices are like now.

Also all the clothing you find that's good material, wash it according to the instructions and NEVER machine dry that stuff only hang dry. It'll last you a long time and will stay looking good albeit it's more work."

I ended up going to thrift stores and eventually finding one that was fine, but this took a bit of time (went to 3 stores over the course of a few days) and this irritated me.

Edit: thanks so much everyone for taking this comment out of context and making me feel like the bad guy. I never implied this was *just* fast fashion, that this was something *easily fixable,* that I am entitled, or that I don't understand my privilege. This is a three sentence comment, only expressing that I don't like fast fashion. Doesn't mean I don't understand its place in society or that complicated nature of the situation. Thanks! Hope y'all feel better now that you've inflated your own egos."

ALDO is currently going under, laying off most of their staff, and not paying their freelance workers for completed work. Imagine what they are doing overseas. The stories go on, warehouse workers in North America getting bankruptcy letters as a justification of not being payed for bills past due. Again, if North America is a place where they can get away with this even though it is more likely there could be legal repercussions, image how they are treating the workers overseas. No. There is no benefit of fast fashion but people still insist on paying $6.99 on a t-shirt that cannot cover the cost of living of human beings. 
We can speak about this and bring up a conversation. Collectively boycotting companies will be a great start, but this is an issue of re-education about our spending and putting our money where our mouth is. Fashion can be a business that employs people worldwide, that engages creatives, that bring us dreamy aesthetics, but we need to be part of that change. I am not saving COVID-19 has not affected small and large businesses, but I am saying that if you have been lucky to have time to reflect on what is actually happen worldwide, you and I need to be more aware about how humans are being treated everywhere. We have more power with our purchases than we believe. Rant over.

Edit: I’m am greatly oversimplifying and skipping over major points of this issue. But without boring you with a longer post, I will always be glad to build on this conversation (and its limitations) from my experiences working in the fashion industry."

Colonialism was based on the foundation that greater separation between workers and consumers enables greater exploitation of said workers. Primark, a European brand that has suppliers based in Bangladesh,India and Pakistan but stores in only Europe and America, is proof that  neo-colonialism exists to this day.
Primark made $8.86 billion in revenues last year,is the largest clothing company in the UK and yet they refuse to pay up. Their stores are crowded even during a pandemic but the workers who made the clothes sold in those stores are now STARVING. 
Primark has a history of malpractice. In 2019, they were one of 29 brands that dismissed workers who were blacklisted due to protesting for higher wages (the minimum wage in Bangladesh is only $95 per month). Prior to the collapse of the Rana Plaza building, the deadliest garment industry accident in history which took over 1,100 lives and injured over 2,500, Primark outsourced from a factory located in that building.  Use of extremely poor quality construction material and maintenance negligence caused the collapse. Cutting costs at the cost of thousands of lives basically.    
Brands like Primark have used a global pandemic to their ADVANTAGE because they know that Asian garment workers are unable to have their voices heard globally. Over 15,000 garment workers took to the streets to protest over unpaid wages but this only received coverage from national news channels and too few online articles.  Delaying payments for clothes that have already been made, month after month should have consequences. Join the #PAYUP movement, lets amplify the voices of our people, they are being exploited to the brink of starvation."

ZeroWaste,Discussion,Raynecorp talking about how fast fashion has destroyed our individual understanding of the value of labor.,,2022,"Bingo. I had a boss that was aware I could sew, and by that I mean mega novice at the time. He asked at the beginning of the pandemic if I would make masks for everyone at the office. I hesitantly agreed, pleading that it was very much new territory for me. We were on quarantine so I got busy learning. Meanwhile, there was a death in my immediate family. I told him I would do what I could but I had to take care of family matters. 

By the time we were back in office I had a fair amount accomplished. He then began telling me I should make them to sell to clients for $5 each, I told him I don't have that kind of time on my hands and wasn't interested. He began telling clients I would make masks for them. One in particular began harassing and demanding to know where HER masks were. She got rather nasty with me. I let her know that he misspoke, overreached and flat out lied to her. I never agreed to such and he doesn't delegate what I do with my time away from that office. 

It was hours of frustrating work being so new to it all, finding out what worked and what didn't. Not a soul appreciated what went into making them. This is a prime example of why I don't sell any crafts that I make. I make jewelery, I crochet, I now sew...and I give them as gifts. I refuse to monetize my hobbies. 

People will get all excited and ask where I got (insert item), they get really excited when I say I made it and they ask how much for said item. They get ANGRY, ridiculously angry when I tell them I don't sell. People do not like being denied that rush for sure."

The cotton was probably domestic too. In today's cash that would be around $45 or so. 

Nowadays, one can buy a pair of jeans for a whopping $12 at Walmart and they are made who knows where in what conditions from cotton grown where with what pesticides etc. Oh, you say, but I can afford to pay $45 for jeans. Well ... that pair of Levi's 501s still have the same issues as the Walmart jeans as do Gap or any other fast fashion brand. If you want to buy high quality with fair labor, you're looking at Japanese made jeans and those aren't $45."

ZeroWaste,Discussion,Raynecorp talking about how fast fashion has destroyed our individual understanding of the value of labor.,,2022,I really appreciate people who acknowledge the fact that we may not be able to avoid some of these brands because we are also being fucked over by capitalism.

I want to live zero waste as much as I can but why does the burden have to fall on low/middle class. Sure every little bit helps but I refuse to feel guilty anymore buying something.

ZeroWaste,Discussion,Raynecorp talking about how fast fashion has destroyed our individual understanding of the value of labor.,,2022,"I've no clue how much labor goes into the stuff on the shelves.  All I see is the price tag and what's on the label.  Of course I'll buy the less expensive item if I can't otherwise tell the difference or don't appreciate why that difference should matter.

Case in point, buying tea.  I can buy organic teas for ~$6 or the same amount of Lipton tea for ~$2.  If anything the Lipton tastes better.  So far as I can tell the Lipton packaging is more responsible/sustainable and the Lipton bags are compostable.  I don't care about some of the things that void the organic label, for example if GM crops are used.  I'm unaware why organic is necessarily better.  So I buy the Lipton.

When all we see is the price tag and can't otherwise tell the difference of course we choose to not pay more.  I do choose to pay more to buy local vegan dressings because in that case I have reason to believe my making that choice contributes to greater abundance.  And the difference in cost is only a few bucks, and the other stuff mostly isn't vegan, and the other stuff that is costs just as much.  One might just as well wonder why the more responsible product shouldn't cost less.  I'd rather make less producing responsible products than make more producing irresponsible products.  I'd happily accept being paid less because money isn't all that matters to me."

unitedkingdom,,Fast fashion: Boohoo breaks promises on ethical overhaul,,2023,"The article is full of scummy behaviour from Boohoo. My personal favourite is they have footage of a supervisor telling factory workers asking to finish their shift to go home and feed their families that “no-one is leaving at 8, or 10, or later”. And then their response to this was “our normal working hours are from 8:00 to 18:00 and it never forces workers to stay late”."
unitedkingdom,,Fast fashion: Boohoo breaks promises on ethical overhaul,,2023,"I hate Boohoo, PrettyLittleThing, Shein, and all of that ilk.

Fast fashion needs to die out, but really, there are so many people that feel they need to have new things constantly rather than buying for long term use; which companies like Boohoo cater to. 

Yes, it’s hard when the cost of living is so high; but charity shops have plenty of nice long lasting things in at low price points even with flippers doing the rounds.

I’ve seen so many people online argue that fast fashion is what’s available to them, so they don’t feel bad about the exploitation and horrible levels of damage to our environment, but there are other options. And when the government won’t step in to stop it, what incentive do companies like Boohoo really have? 

When you have Depop and Vinted, aside from charity shops, you don’t need these websites. You can get things that are better for less. I don’t get the constant need for new clothing when that clothing is going to fall apart anyway, and that clothing makes you look as good as you would look dressed in a sack."

unitedkingdom,,Fast fashion: Boohoo breaks promises on ethical overhaul,,2023,"Nobody should be shocked by this.

You can't sell clothes for Boohoo/Shein/PLT prices and not exploit other human beings, it's impossible.

I work in clothing production. We agree on prices before we place orders, and that's the price we pay unless the factory seriously fucks up (and then we ask for a 10% discount and settle on 5%). The lowest price we pay for a shirt is around £16 and that is construction only, not materials. Boggles the mind BH are paying less than £5 for a dress. We audit all our factories yearly for social, safety and environmental standards, which should be the case everywhere. But then you wouldn't be able to buy a dress for £10."

Really it extends to some major high st chains as well. This isn't just limited to countries overseas, there is a network of exploited workers in the UK also. The market for many cheap fast consumption items is riddled with this issue. It's inherent in the proposition of items which are non perishable becoming fmcg. The industry will not survive without exploitation. So the question becomes, what type of society do we want to have? 

If we want fast fashion, we must accept exploitation and change our definition of ethics. 

I don't even believe that the will or the means to make this choice exist at the present time."

That can depend where you live, your fashion sense and your size. I do not use fast fashion but charity shops near me are terrible for clothes.

Charity shops are useless in my experience."
unitedkingdom,,Fast fashion: Boohoo breaks promises on ethical overhaul,,2023,"It’s a massive issue for many reasons. 

Fast fashion clothes are super stylish but don’t last, they’re good for a few wears then they’re literally worthless - charity shops struggle to sell them because people know they’ve cheap to begin with, nobody wants to pay £5 for a second hand boohoo dress but it’s not worth the effort of the charity shop to sell it for much less.

So it gets sold to textile recyclers where it will be turned into some cheap mattress stuffing or shipped abroad to be sold on/recycled there; either way the carbon and water footprint of that item is fucking huge. 

Charity shops are swamped with low cost fast fashion and they’re not gonna get decent money for it, so most is sold on to the recyclers.

Even stuff in wearable condition, the whole stigma around these brands being cheap tat is right there on the label. People do not want it unless it’s super cheap or new. 

If you remove the label it actually becomes easier to sell, I’ve done this with some flannel shirts before, nobody wanted them when they were Primark but take the labels out and you can get a tenner for them."

femalefashionadvice,,Breaking up with fast fashion - what does it mean to you?,"There are so many posts and research articles that talk about consumers wanting to invest in sustainable and ethical fashion, particularly after the pandemic, but fast fashion companies like Boohoo and Asos keep turning profits, with increasing share prices (compared to 12 months ago).  I was just interested to see if there are others on FFA who are looking to move away from fast fashion and what might be keeping you from making the switch (if at all)?  Is it availability of styles, costs or maybe the generous delivery / returns offered by the big conglomerates that keep us glued?  

I'm in the infancy of my journey to living more sustainably and trying to be more conscious in my habits and sometimes I do struggle.  Particularly with fashion, as I feel there is an added layer of research that's required before I purchase something from an ethical producer or brand, to make sure that the company I'm buying from is really doing the right thing and not simply saying they are...so for me it's more of a time investment.  Do others feel this way about the effort or is it something else?",2021,"I have a hard time finding clothes in styles I like from ethical companies. Lots of them specialize in basics, which I have found are the easiest items to locate secondhand, and not really my style anyways. I’ve had luck with thrifting in the past (which doesn’t work for everyone), and I’m decently skilled at sewing so I have the extra benefit of being able to alter thrifted clothes or make clothes instead of buying new if possible (even using secondhand fabric to make clothing with). 

One of the best lines I heard about sustainable clothing choices is “the most sustainable wardrobe is the one you already have.” Even if someone can’t afford to buy a $60 white tee from an ethical producer, they can still lessen their impact by not buying anything at all and wearing the items they already own. Examining our own wasteful behaviours and shopping with intention is key - it’s an easy (and more fun) switch to say you’re only buying stuff from Everlane instead of H&M from now on, but it’s a harder adjustment to realize you buy too many clothes and need to reevaluate your shopping altogether.

So I guess for me the approach is two-pronged in that I primarily shop secondhand as the starting point, but above that I prioritize being intentional about acquiring clothes, whether that’s from the thrift store, the mall, or making it myself."

Do others feel this way about the effort or is it something else?",2021,"I do want to be a thoughtful consumer. But I'm a little disenchanted with the idea of ethical and sustainable companies whose goal is ultimately still to get you to purchase from them. 

Your comment about spending a lot of time researching ""ethical"" brands definitely resonates. They're probably better options than fast fashion, sure. But I don't want to fall into the mindset of thinking that me buying stuff is actually somehow a positive for the environment. 

So I mostly focus on repairing what I already have and buying secondhand when possible, instead of putting my energy into figuring out which brand is the most ethical. I still buy things new occasionally. 

Side note: I think it's flawed to think of a purchase as an ""investment,"" no matter how well the companies market themselves. This particular language shift is a pet peeve of mine. Ok, sure, the idea is that the extra money is worth it because it returns more value to you in nontangible ways. But shouldn't all successful purchases do that? I feel like the word investment has been co-opted as a sort of vague catch-all for any expensive clothing item, as a way to imply high quality. 

I also have thoughts about how insidious it is that the burden of saving the environment has been placed on the individual as a consumer, rather than changing the systems we have. And how it's kind of a mindfuck, but despite all my efforts and time, purchasing carbon offsets is the simplest and probably most effective thing I've been able to do. That and voting. Doesn't mean I'm giving up responsibility as an individual. But it's just weird to think about."

If I buy a piece from a ""fast fashion"" brand and then proceed to wear it for years (which I definitely have)... is it still fast fashion? I agree on the fact that these companies are targetting current fashion trends in a way to get people to turn over their clothes more. However, not everyone can afford these ""ethical brands"" (and they may not meet our style of dress). 

Alternatively, if we make the conscious choice to buy things that are likely to be long-term residents in our wardrobes no matter where we get them are they still fast fashion?  To me, this mindset when buying new clothes ideally is the best way to go about being sustainable and ultimately ""breaking up"" with fast fashion."

This requires two wardrobes - a work wardrobe, and a ""hey I'm still young and I like crop tops and ripped jeans"" wardrobe.  The two don't overlap a lot- when I'm not at work I don't WANT to look mature and put together all the time, I want to look young and trendy.

The problem is I definitely don't make enough money to sustain two entirely different styles and purchase only from ethical companies.  I try to thrift as much as possible, but it's much more time consuming to comb through Goodwill or Depop and I work 45 hours a week and go to college online.  It's so much easier to see a cute Zara dress on Instagram and just quickly order it.

I know these are excuses and so my compromise has been to just buy less.  I also utilize places like Plato's Closet a lot because even though they're more expensive than a Goodwill Salvation Army, I can spend less time picking through racks since it's more curated with trendy stuff."

1. Buy nothing (wear what you already own)
2. Buy second hand
3. .
4. .
5. Buy sustainably

Ethical and sustainable fashion is really hard to define, there is no unified certification body and so many variables that could make it more or less sustainable. Polyester is bad because it comes from fossil fuels. But leather is also bad because it contributes to animal agriculture and animal cruelty. Vegan leather is just plastic and again usually comes from fossil fuels. But cotton is also bad because its cultivation contributes significantly to both environmental pollution and modern-day slavery. Plus, that cotton was probably produced with monoculture. Does there exist non-monoculture sources of cotton? If you buy a non-organic cotton shirt that is made locally, is that better than an organic shirt that had to be shipped from overseas? Are the workers being paid a fair wage? How can any of us really be sure what the conditions really are like in the factories?

I think the most important thing to keep in mind is that the vast majority of the environmental footprint of a piece of garment comes from the wearing, not the making. You can buy the most ethical/sustainable clothes but if you're donating them every few months to buy new stuff, it's still going to have a much bigger impact than a F21 shirt someone wore for several years."

I did try to buy more from ""ethical"" brands a few years ago, and was largely disappointed - the quality, fit, and design was not up to par with the price point.

I don't pay *too* much attention to the particular brand or whether it's ""fast"" fashion or not. I look at materials and how durable a garment looks on it's face. 

Most of the stuff I buy new are things that are going to be wardrobe staples that I can easily accessorize to spruce up.  Or things that can easily be mixed and matched with other things I own. 

The most sustainable way to shop for clothes is always going to be to buy fewer things, buy used, and get as much use out of what you do buy as possible."

E.g. the primary problem is the mindless habitual consumerism of buying a whole new wardrobe every couple of seasons. Conscious consumerism is buying what you need and what you will wear. I think a good rule of thumb for not partaking in fast fashion is not buying more than 5 pieces a season and not owning more than 7 of anything. (In general you will only need to own more than that of your uniform, like scrubs or jeans or whatever you wear for work). In reality I find that most seasons I keep my wardrobe to 37 pieces including shoes and bags, which doesn’t sound like much but actually is a lot, and I actually rarely buy 5 items a season. Regardless of where you’re buying from, I think you can take the step of buying less, and buying more second hand. 

Definitely ethical fashion takes a lot more research, and it can be daunting because lots of brands are pretty green washed."

1. Reduce the number of clothes you buy in the first place

lots of people can afford $100+ single items, but there are just sooo many more that just can’t. i also just don’t trust that every company that says they use sustainable practices actually do, so i’m hesitant to buy without doing a lot of research, which is something a lot of people don’t have the time/energy/interest in doing. a lot of people just need something to wear to work, or they want cheap clothes to send their kids to school in without thinking about it. if you don’t have an interest in fashion or the environment and don’t have a lot of money, you’re probably not buying $100 bamboo sweatpants to lounge around in. 

for me personally, i’ve bought considerably less over the last decade, and only buy things that i know i will wear and get a lot of use out of, even if it is fast fashion. i also buy a lot of things secondhand, which is a chore in and of itself sometimes. i think it’s a reasonably solution to environmentalism but i can understand why people don’t like to do it. 

i think the bottom line is that sustainable and ethical solutions have to be geared toward everyone that wears clothes, which is, well pretty much everyone. this includes poor people, busy people, people that don’t care at all about fashion, and those with kids, disabilities, or other issues where they just don’t have time to worry about where their clothes came from or who made them. and right now, most of the options for sustainability are marketed towards the same people most products and services are geared towards - those that have plenty of money and time on their hands."

Particularly with fashion, as I feel there is an added layer of research that's required before I purchase something from an ethical producer or brand, to make sure that the company I'm buying from is really doing the right thing and not simply saying they are...so for me it's more of a time investment.  Do others feel this way about the effort or is it something else?",2021,"Breaking up with fast fashion :

1. Its a mindset, and the actions that follow.
2. Its teaching myself to be content and love what I own. Its teaching myself to wear what I have, over and over again.
3. Its less to do with what other things to buy from certain brands. (I see that there is some anxiety in the market on how to afford expensive clothes while getting rid of currently usable clothes.) I have already invested on my needs in the past. Wearing them till they fall apart, is the best reward for the investments already made.
4. Its checking out of the cycle of ""let me check out what the brands made this season. What are the influencers wearing ? What is my fav sustainable brand churning out this year ?"" Its a certain calm where the focus is inwards, than outwards. Its finding the joy in wearing what I own and not seeking out stimulation from the markets to appreciate clothes.
5. To find a replacement is taxing. It involves search for the right item, learning about how its made, trying to figure out if its high quality, trying to assess if its repairable, ..... This exercise should dis-incentivize how much I buy. I cant possibly do this search without spending significant energy. I try to limit to less than 10 additions a year. Else, its all too much effort.
6. By wearing an item made by fast fashion brand a 100+ times, I made it slow fashion. I slowed down fashion and redeemed the garment. ( Sometimes, cheap clothes are used as a yard stick to beat up women who cant afford more expensive clothes. Any one who wears something a hundred times, speaks the language of slow fashion. Most of the time, the rich buy from sustainable brands but wear it too little given the size of their closets. They made slow fashion into fast fashion, which is a terrible waste too. )
7. I stopped buying clothes that are meant to be worn for special occasions. I have been wearing the same dressy garment, for all dressy events, for the last 6 years.
8. Wear 80% of my closet 80% of the time.  ( As opposed to wearing 20% of the closet, 80% of the time and hoarding the rest. )
9. Never use the dryer. Clothes last longer. Use a gummy bag to wash sports clothes. Use gentle wash cycles and spot clean.
10. Buy clothes in relaxed fit. I cant be changing wardrobes every time my weight fluctuates. For it does!! for women given our hormonal changes with life cycles we go through. In my 20s, I tried buying the smallest sizes I fit into. Since late 20s, I bought the size that had some extra room without looking sloppy. I am still wearing these garments in my mid-30s.
11. Over-dye clothes. They will collect stains. I dye mine black or navy to give them a refresh.
12. For tight budgets, Uniqlo mades study clothes that last. It is not the worst of the fast fashion brands.
13. Shop second hand.

I think slow fashion has less to do with brands to buy from and more to do with us, citizens and finding zen in wear."

Do others feel this way about the effort or is it something else?",2021,"For me it's about worker's rights first and foremost. It's cliche to say it, but it's modern day slavery. In the words of the Dutch designer, Li Edelkoort “How can a product that needs to be sown, grown, harvested, combed, spun, knitted, cut and stitched, finished, printed, labelled, packaged and transported cost a couple of Euros?”

No, it's not the consumer's responsibility to ensure worker conditions but I believe in grassroots change and the fact that normal people are talking about it and it's such a hot topic right now that so many big companies are greenwashing, shows that consumers can influence the market. 

I started my journey last year when I saw how many large, wealthy companies refused to pay garment workers for garments that had already been made at the height of the pandemic. I'd been trying to slow my consumption down already but it gave me the kick in the arse to actually make an effort to find clothing brands that fit my ethics. I don't shop 100% ethically still because I think there are gaps in the market and secondhand shopping isn't always an option. But I look to ethical shops first. My standards might not be every shop needs to be a B Corp but I like to check that there's some transparency on where the factories are, whether they have third party certification and what worker rights are.

If you are interested, I shared a list of all of the ethical brands that were colourful and affordable in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/o2qr70/100_ethical_uk_fashion_brands_including_colourful/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) last month. They are UK brands as that's where I am based but I think it proves that not all ethical fashion is baggy, shapeless and devoid of creativity.

I am of the mindset that everyone doing what they can is better than a few people acting perfectly. I also think that there is a lot of nuance in any conversation about ethics so there is no one right way to do something."

I love it so much that 98% of my wardrobe is from there. I’ve literally “curated” a wardrobe over the past 9 years. If you’ve tried a brand that you know is consistent in sizes, and you know what size you take by that brand, search for their dress styles on there. Just be aware that you’re responsible for reading the listings (if there’s a stain, damaged zipper, hole, etc it should be in the listing). If there’s damage not listed when you receive the item, you have two days from receiving the dress to file a claim and return it. (It’s technically 3 days but I don’t wait). BUT- if it doesn’t fit you, you’re stuck with it.   

I literally got a $595 Elizabeth and James dress for $59 (plus shipping) with the tags still on in perfect condition. 

My favorite brands for dresses…. Yumi Kim, Elizabeth and James, Alice + Olivia, elliatt, Bronx and banco, reformation, realisation, Karen millen, Amanda uprichard, joie, Alexis, Nicholas, house of CB, Mischa collection, jay Godfrey, nookie, self portrait, Alexia admore, and cinq a sept. 

I’m 37f for reference, current size 10, and I’d describe my style as classic, sexy, and feminine. Basically, I like looking “put together” and lady-like! I hope that helps!

They have a wide range of styles, sizes, and price points. Dresses go on sale frequently.  Their return policy is very generous, so you can buy or order several and return what doesn't work, either by mail or by dropping off at a store (there really isn't a set number of days for the return window).  And if you sign up for the Nordy's club (you don't have to get a store credit card to participate), you get free alterations.  

Not everything they sell will last forever, but they do have lots of good quality choices and I have noticed a lot more sustainable brands and fabrics, lately.

Thrift stores and Poshmark are great ideas, too.  But you have to have a good amount of time to dig through the racks at thrift stores.  You can find great deals on Poshmark, but the return policy is really tough. I think it's best to find a brand or style you love and know your size in and then check to see what similar options are available. 

At any given time, I only have a couple of dresses to wear to weddings and other dressy events.  But I figure wearing the same dress to events where I see different people works fine, and if you switch up shoes, accessories, and wraps or jackets, you don't look like you're wearing the same thing all the time."

The dresses are modern yet timeless, quality fabrics and designs and most of all, the most flattering dresses I’ve tried on (and I tried on dozens in the last years looking for special event dresses).  Pick up sale dresses for the next time the season rolls around,  and or pick up on special dress that costs more but can be used over and over.  

It’s pricey but so worth it imo.  Note: I also noticed somehow the dresses actually look BETTER in person than on the website which means they use wonderful fabrics.  I was intrigued by the website dresses but I was in love when I tried them on.

LifeProTips,Clothing,LPT: learn how to tell the quality of a garments construction by feel and sight- it will save you money and reduce your contribution to fast fashion,"My mother was a fashion exec for most of her career. She taught me young how to tell by feel if a garment is made well.

Get a feel for how to tell when stuff is well made, it will pay off in spades. I shop anywhere from Walmart to Nordstrom’s to Anthropologie. If you get good at telling instantly if a piece of clothing will last you a long time, it will go far in saving you money and reducing your contribution to fast fashion. *Price is not remotely related to garment construction.* I know that’s surprising but it’s the truth. Expensive clothes are often you paying for the brand or the fancy store’s rent that you found it in. Even fast fashion stores like Zara and Primark have cheap and cute gems scattered around that will actually last you. 

Example: loosely knit sweaters are always risky. Denim for women is rarely made well, and wears out quickly even designer jeans. You want thick fabric for denim for long lasting clothing. For all clothes you want sturdy seams, look at how neat they are. Sloppy seams don’t hold up. You also want fabric that won’t dissolve easily, even when something is sheer. 

As a result I don’t have to buy clothing very often. Nor do I have to buy expensive clothing to look great. I do occasionally but not frequently. I find roughly the same proportion of well made to poorly made clothing at all prices. Designer clothes are sometimes made very well and are in those cases perhaps worth it. But most are made poorly and will look like shit after one to two washes.

Some brands are more trustworthy than others (Frye boots I swear by), but even then there is always variation between products.

Get a feel for how to tell when stuff is well made, it will pay off in spades. I shop anywhere from Walmart to Nordstrom’s to Anthropologie. If you get good at telling instantly if a piece of clothing will last you a long time, it will go far in saving you money and reducing your contribution to fast fashion. *Price is not remotely related to garment construction.* I know that’s surprising but it’s the truth. Expensive clothes are often you paying for the brand or the fancy store’s rent that you found it in. Even fast fashion stores like Zara and Primark have cheap and cute gems scattered around that will actually last you. 

Example: loosely knit sweaters are always risky. Denim for women is rarely made well, and wears out quickly even designer jeans. You want thick fabric for denim for long lasting clothing. For all clothes you want sturdy seams, look at how neat they are. Sloppy seams don’t hold up. You also want fabric that won’t dissolve easily, even when something is sheer. 

As a result I don’t have to buy clothing very often. Nor do I have to buy expensive clothing to look great. I do occasionally but not frequently. I find roughly the same proportion of well made to poorly made clothing at all prices. Designer clothes are sometimes made very well and are in those cases perhaps worth it. But most are made poorly and will look like shit after one to two washes.

Some brands are more trustworthy than others (Frye boots I swear by), but even then there is always variation between products.

If it’s wool and it tells you hand wash, do not wring, OK.  That’s about wool fibers.  If you love it and you’re willing to care for it, it can last a long time.  

But if it’s some flimsy woven synthetic with that kind of care direction, that means it’s going to fall apart with normal use."

If the lines are crooked or jagged, pass.

On a related note, if you have access to a sewing machine, you can go over the seams (nothing visible, just the construction seams, like the side seam or the inseam of pants) with a shorter stitch length.  Most commercial machines use very large stitches to go faster, and the lines of stitching break quickly.  I’ve prolonged the life of many of my clothes just by resewing the seams.

Also look at your local dry cleaners for alterations.  It’s amazing what they can fix and how inexpensive it can be."

I gave up and tried a t-shirt from the men’s section, just out of curiosity. And it worked. No more of my shrinking, twisting, or frayed yarn. They were comfortable and easy to wear (felt pretty thick compared to women’s t-shirts) and they felt great with none of the extra designs or decals.

I proceeded to do what was deemed a fashion no-no (for girls and in my experience) and bought 10 more of the same shirt, but different colors.

Its been great not being stuck to shitty clothes. And I even moved onto men’s jackets as the women’s jacket were also made with weird designs or they felt super cheap. Just need to adjust arm length with a tailor or by doing it myself."

Eventually she asked her about it -- she told her that if my mum look carefully she'd notice she wore the same basic outfit - black/white trousers, or blue jeans, with a solid coloured top. The only thing that changed where her accessories - bags, shoes, scarves and jewellery.

She figured out early that trends are cyclical so she just held onto any accessories that were part of a passing trend.

Leopard print is in? She has a leopard print scarf she bought from Primark 20 years ago, that she pairs with a black tee, black pants, and leopard print shoes.

Ditto for 'tropical', she wears basic trousers, with plain top and a tropical print cardigan that she bought the last time tropics were 'in'.

So although she's buying from places like Zara, H&M, Primark etc, she's not disposing of the items, just rotating them as and when they come back into fashion."

What’s your go to way to prevent clothing waste while still staying in timely outfits?",2019,"1. look for trends you like where ever you buy used clothing. Animal print and neon (for example)  have been in before, and shouldn't be terribly hard to find used in this age of poshmark/depop/thredup.
2. keep an eye on what makeup techniques/hairstyles/clothing styling tricks (such as the french tuck) are in right now, because looking timely doesn't have to be about buying new things
3. don't buy clothes before you need them. If you wash your work pants every other wear, work monday-friday and do laundry weekly, you do not need more than three pairs of work pants. Let them get worn, and when the time comes for you to buy another pair, try to pick them up in a current cut.
4. Don't be afraid to update your current pieces via tailoring/cuffing. If you're considering buying a new pair of ankle pants to wear to work a more sustainable option is having an older pair you have hemmed (and possibly tapered) to fit the current trend of silhouette. Old skinny jeans are longer than you'd like? Cuff em a few times.

Tl;dr: Buy less, buy used, keep your hair/face/tucks current, tailor your things"

But if you are looking to follow trends, they generally still flow into more long lasting clothing as well, maybe in a less obvious way.

I’m a visual merchandiser and I have been one for the past two years or so and I’ve been working for the company for almost 5 years. I’ve noticed a trend throughout the past few years I’ve been there. We basically get the same stuff every year along with a few things that are new and different. We separate the clothes by a certain style that’s “trending” and even though it seems like fast fashion is always changing, in a way it’s not. The only main difference is is that once we put specific things together to creat a certain style, the next year we’ll get similar stuff but mix other things with it to make it look different. We’ll mix different patterns together, we’ll make it more creative with certain accessories, fabrics, etc. so I’m glad I became a visual because it helped me realize that I can keep the clothes I have but just switch it around and create new outfits. I’ve tricked my co workers thinking I keep buying new stuff and I tell them every time that I’ve had most of my clothes for years. You just got to get inspiration for trending styles and go through your closet and create an outfit."

What’s your go to way to prevent clothing waste while still staying in timely outfits?",2019,"One thing I do is I only buy according to a certain color palette. So about 90% of my clothes are black, white, and grey. Most of the rest are accent colors-- a light weight yellow button down, a couple sweaters in orange and red, a hot pink hoodie. I have a couple of things that aren't in that palette, but it's because I *loved* them so much I had to have them. 

Jeans are kind of an exception, but I only buy jeans that fit really well with no rips, holes, or any other kind of hawt accents. I try to keep my jeans limited to those that would work for casual Fridays at the office.

Anyway-- that's my trick for keeping my closet simple and not going overboard on fast fashion. I can find the cutest things in lots of crazy colors, but I use the color palette as a way to keep from filling up my closet with things I won't wear or won't wear more than a couple times. 

At the same time, when I find something adorable, I buy multiple versions. If they have it in black, white, grey, a black+grey striped version, and a black with white polka dots version, there's a decent chance I will buy all 5 colors. 

This works really well to keep me from buying that lime green jumpsuit that's on clearance for SUCH a good deal. It keeps me from buying 10 shades of purple and pink tank tops because they are on sale for only $7! 

I have started noticing that some of my clothes are looking very worn. Not dated, but worn out from constant use for years. I started this in 2012, and after my initial trip to goodwill, I haven't needed to clean out my closet once. 

Lately, I have been getting a bit tired of the black, white, and grey palette. I was thinking about trying out a new palette... maybe navy, burgundy, and grey. For accents, I could use white, lime green, and lavender colors. I also considered going really bright-- like Google colors, but I suck at laundry, so I worry the bright colors would fade and not last me for years like the dark colors have."

It's not just about the waste the fashion industry creates but how badly it treats its workers and how devastating it is to the planet.  So yes, you can buy something from H&M and wear it for years.  That would be less wasteful but that's not the only reason to avoid shopping with them; someone could have literally died to make your clothes, and I'm not OK with that so I refuse to shop with these brands.

However, quitting fast fashion is a huge privilege, I get that.  Although a lot of us could do better if we're honest with ourselves.  If we stopped shopping as a hobby and didn't buy a dozen new items every months, we could invest in fewer items of better quality clothing."

This may be unrealistic given the time/resources involved, but learning how to make your own clothes is a great way to limit what you buy. There is still fabric waste, but at least there's significantly less exploited human labor involved. Plus you get to make *exactly* what you want.

One example is a dress I got at the thrift store. It looks as if it was made for me and I spent $4 on it. I bought it last summer and I have worn it over forty times. I definitely got my money’s worth.

Nothing will make you want to keep your wardrobe as small as possible as having to put in all the work yourself to produce well-made garments of good-quality material.  It also encourages you to ride the inside of the trend curve, which makes you more likely to be able to continue wearing a garment after the trend has passed.

This said, I'll paraphrase what the almighty Bernadette Banner--who is so anti-fast-fashion she's wearing clothing designs from 120+ years ago on a regular basis--said about her H&M blouse: ""if you wear it, take care of it, and mend it when it needs it, you're still reducing waste and keeping it out of the landfill."""

Also buy in natural materials. Plant based fibers and wool break down in a non-harmful way to the environment. Acrylics & other plastic based threads shed microplastics every time you wash them. So opting for biodegradable fibers is definitely better than synthetics. 

There is a lot of talk about this in the fiber arts community. Some of us are even trying to go zero-waste. I would definitely recommend looking through instagram or etsy to find some sustainable knitwear/crochet/handsewn shops to browse."

What’s your go to way to prevent clothing waste while still staying in timely outfits?",2019,"Personally, I actually avoid the Marie Kondo “sparks joy” mindset. I try to keep my clothes for a long time and keep them in good condition. That way I can bring stuff back when trends cycle in and out. Keeping stuff may not work for everyone, but I have enough closet space to keep my clothes for a while as long as they still fit and look good on. 

For example: I have a cream colored drapey sweater that I bought in high school. I wore it a lot then, but as cardigans came back in style, I didn’t wear it for probably 5 years. When drapey sweaters came back in over the last few years, I wore it a bunch and got a lot of compliments. 

I also find ways to wear my “less-trendy” clothes.  Low-waisted pants don’t look that dated if you wear them with shirts covering the waistband.

Certain items also don’t really go out of style. Sundresses will always be in for the summer. Sweaters will always be acceptable for winter. Even if it’s not this year’s preferred cut/color/pattern, you can wear them for years. Same with “preppy” styles if you’re into that. You may not look stylish, but you won’t be wrong."

-Buying from thrift stores as much as possible. Nowadays I do a lot of my shopping on Poshmark. 

-If I’m going to get anything brand new I try to support independent designers instead. I’ve found quite a lot of reasonably priced shops on Etsy for example. 

-I put a lot of my clothes in laundry bags when I put them through the wash so they last longer. Even the fast fashion pieces that I own stay in good condition for a fair amount of time because of this.

-In order to reinvent my wardrobe, I’ve taken up embroidery! Im good at drawing so it’s easy for me to come up with designs to put on my clothes. I’m still practicing and not very good at actually stitching, but once I’m confident enough  I’m gonna stitch cute flowers and snakes on my dresses and stuff ^_^ also having this hobby means less time online shopping

-Continuing the DIY/reinventing route, for things like jackets/jeans/bags/hats etc I’ve started collecting patches. Sure, it’s consuming but I try to buy straight from indie artists and designers. Feels a lot better to buy a screenprinted patch from Etsy or a local craft fair than getting a new shirt from H&M. 

-Also, unfollowing/unliking a lot of fast fashion brands on social media. Also limiting time on your phone/computer helps a lot (easier said than done of course)."

How do you avoid fast fashion? 

What’s your go to way to prevent clothing waste while still staying in timely outfits?",2019,"This is a wonderful, thoughtful question.  Awesome replies and ideas!

Thrifting, thoughtful purchasing, sustainable brands, clothes exchange parties, buying better quality, and removing the causes for impulse purchasing (certain media feeds, for example) are all helpful.

I'd like to speak a little bit as to the *why* it is so difficult to avoid fast fashion. I hope that's okay.

Avoiding fast fashion is *HARD* because there has been a coordinated effort in our society to only care about the bottom line. Your life - All Our Lives - are very carefully orchestrated to make the fast, cheap, out-of-control option the easiest.  By making your life difficult, or expensive, or inconvenient, it is **by design** that you will go for the easy/cheap thing. Be it fast food or fast fashion.

Billions of dollars every year are spent to very carefully craft the best ways to keep you and me dependent on the corporate offerings.

**It is very hard to break away because corporations actively make it hard to break away.**  And the methods are sneaky. Often times it is layers within layers within layers. A shell non-profit or NGO may be stopping an easement for a public road, or zoning issues, for example.  

Is there a farmers market in your town? A free community garden? Are you even allowed to use your own gardens, that you own - to grow food? (check your zoning laws. it may surprise you)  Why or why not?  Ah-- but is there an easily accessible, publicly-funded and maintained road to a shopping center, right? That is not to make your life or your community better.  It is to fund corporations.  End stop.

&#x200B;

 By choosing to opt-out of fast anything it takes resources - time or money - to circumvent fast fashion.  Every effort to control your time, energy, and money is exerted.

It is much easier to go to Target/Inno/MegaStore or H&M than it is to spend hours looking for a suitable substitute that did not cost the lives of ten year olds, or poison the village water supply. It is even better in you never find out about the poisoned water supply, or do not think of the lives that getting you this item took.  If your life is busy/stressful/difficult enough, you do not need to think of others, you only need to think if this is easy/good for you.

That said, **Do Not Beat Yourself Up** over using the corporate solution. Make better, sustainable choices more often, in more areas, and over time.  If the larger corporations start seeing that the sustainable and ethical solutions are the profitable ones, they too will adopt those as business practices. I'm not anti-Target or Inno.  I'm pro-Target stocking only non-toxic, sustainable merchandise.  I like convenience. I just want my convenience not to contain BPA or be responsible for Rana Plaza style disasters, yo. And I am willing to put in the extra effort to avoid items that do not fall in line with my ethics.

&#x200B;

**You are not making a purchasing decision** for a cute top for the party.  You are having to go against an entire systemic intrastructure  that is designed to get you to impulse buy a cute top for the party. I can not overstate the reach.   No wonder it feels super difficult to avoid fast fashion.

There are lots of reasons - cost, geolocation, size exclusion, etc. that ethical fashion remains unaccessable for many people.

Hopelessness/depression/self care is another barrier.  Sometimes, for some people, when they can not take care of themselves, they're not too worried about taking care of their basic needs, much less the people who made the clothes, or the planet.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Be aware, be educated.  Every single thing in your life is designed to keep you dependent upon the ideas that built fast-fashion and disposable, toxic consumables. Make good choices. Do the best you can, as often as you can. You are worth the extra effort."

2: Don't go to the mall or online shopping as entertainment or activity, only go when you need a very specific item (I don't follow this myself as much as I should!) 

3: Learn about textiles and materials and sewing. When you learn to recognize quality items, fast fashion becomes *much* less appealing and you'll probably drop to purchasing maybe 5 novelty items a year because the finish, notions, fabrics, and stitching are just...not great on most fast fashion items. 

4: Vintage and thrift, as many others have pointed out. Although, to be fair, actual real 90s clothing often looks subtly different than repro from UO and thrifting isn't always an easy option for all."

femalefashionadvice,,I am a commercial womenswear designer who has worked for well-known fast fashion brands across the US and UK...AMA about the fashion industry!,"Hi FFA!

My name is Emma, I am a commercial womenswear designer with over 10 years experience in the fashion industry. I’m here to answer any questions you have about what goes on behind-the-scenes in the “real” world of fashion

A little more about myself. I grew up in a small town in Kent, England, about an hour south of London. I started my career interning for luxury brands like Diane Von Furstenberg in NYC as well as Matthew Williamson, House of Holland and French Connection in London. Eventually I transitioned into fast fashion, working for both well-known and smaller retailers across the US and UK, including Primark, Debenhams, Urban Outfitters, Honey Punch and ZSupply. I’ve designed every type of garment you can think of (some of you have probably even worn some of my designs!)

A career in fashion can be tough, and it definitely hasn’t always been an easy journey! I’ve recently launched “**Fashion and the Free**” ([www.fashionandthefree.com](https://www.fashionandthefree.com)), a content platform for Fashion Industry creatives and professionals to share their stories, advice and experiences.

I started this site after realizing most fashion-oriented publications focus almost entirely on luxury brands, big name designers, and famous faces - often painting a picture that doesn’t accurately capture what it’s like in the “real” world of the industry. So I’ve reached out to colleagues across the world to share the perspectives of the countless thousands of people involved in making the clothes most of you wear.

The goal of the platform is to break down the walls and provide a more accessible view of it all. I also hope to address some controversial topics on the minds of many workers & fashion enthusiasts - like the struggles of sustainable fashion, cut-throat work environments, breaking into the industry, and the difficulties faced by some garment workers.

I'm happy to answer questions on topics like the design process, trend forecasting, life working in the industry, working as an expat overseas, sustainability, the effects of COVID-19, or anything else you want to know!

Reading your other replies got me thinking...the wastefulness and negative aspects of fast fashion are often discussed in fashion. When I think of fast fashion, I think of cheaply made clothes to mimic the latest trends, that consumers will probably not wear longer than a season.

But what about the high-end luxury brands that are copied by fast fashion retailers? The consumers of those high-end brands also likely purchase items that are trendy for a season, and don't get much use out of it later. Is the only real difference the volume of product made? Should we be applying the same scrutiny regarding wastefulness and the environment to high-end brands? Do you have any insights from the industry about the attitude towards these issues?"

I've noticed that in fast fashion that a lot of women's clothes are mostly made a various array of synthetic materials rather than natural fibers such as cotton or linen. Even in the US south where the highs can reach 30-35 C (or higher) in the summer, it's extremely difficult to find clothes that aren't synthetic, even though those natural fibers are better for staying cool.

My name is Emma, I am a commercial womenswear designer with over 10 years experience in the fashion industry. I’m here to answer any questions you have about what goes on behind-the-scenes in the “real” world of fashion

A little more about myself. I grew up in a small town in Kent, England, about an hour south of London. I started my career interning for luxury brands like Diane Von Furstenberg in NYC as well as Matthew Williamson, House of Holland and French Connection in London. Eventually I transitioned into fast fashion, working for both well-known and smaller retailers across the US and UK, including Primark, Debenhams, Urban Outfitters, Honey Punch and ZSupply. I’ve designed every type of garment you can think of (some of you have probably even worn some of my designs!)

I started this site after realizing most fashion-oriented publications focus almost entirely on luxury brands, big name designers, and famous faces - often painting a picture that doesn’t accurately capture what it’s like in the “real” world of the industry.

I've noticed for average sizes like 10 and up, the cuts tend to be boxier and look good on few people. Now I know that people hold their weight differently, but what gives? Is there some consideration for this when making a pattern? Melissa McCarthy said that she was sick of having huge arm holes in plus size clothing, so she helped design her own line. When you make a pattern for sizes 10 and up, are you just making it larger than the smaller sizes? I noticed that underwear companies are horrible with this. Larger women are going to probably have larger tummies, but there is never enough fabric on underwear! Even on the ads I see tummy pooches peeking out UNDER the undies, which trust me is never comfortable. Do different brands cater to different body shapes and/or use the same type of fit models? I am bustier and noticed, for example, Rag and Bone always looks and fits me great."

Thank you for doing this AMA. A couple of topics came up here recently tha had me thinking. What does the patterning process look like at the fast fashion and the luxury brands you worked at? Do they all have their own pattern-makers? And are the patterns from the luxury brands more intricate and difficult to construct than those from the fast-fashion brands?

How does competition between a brand and a retailer of that brand work? If a brand wants to sell directly to the consumer they can have their own store. But the retailers that stock that brand are selling the same pieces for the same price. Is the brand not undercutting a store it has a business relationship with?"

Crochet can’t be produced by a machine, it’s only handmade. That means this is only affordable through underpaid labor.

It really sucks because crochet clothing is incredibly trendy these days, and the prices for handmade items are expensive, so naturally, people are looking for cheaper options. 

I hate it because not only are there underpaid workers behind the scenes, but also, people are getting the impression that crochet items are something that can be bought at cheap prices. It almost devalues the work of others, because people begin to say, “ok, I can buy it cheaper at shein, it must not be worth *that* much.”"

If you look closely at the stitches in fast fashion “crochet” pieces you can usually see that they aren’t real crochet stitches.

Shein is one of the largest contributors to waste, wage theft and pollution around. 

Don't. Buy. Shein.

Edit- well this is blowing up. I'm not attacking. I'm stating facts. It is ALSO true that fast fashion has ruined the industry and there are many people who cannot avoid it. 

It's not about being perfect, it's about being informed. The most ethical clothes are the ones you ALREADY OWN. Clothing yourself isn't a crime, over consuming is the issue. Clothes are mad poorly so you over consume. Learning how to properly care for, mend and upcycle what you have is the best thing you can do

Everything is problematic currently. It's an industry issue, not a flaw on you personally. But knowing the top offenders, looking into alternatives, finding buy sell trade groups for your size, style, region etc, working with what you have and mending are all really not hard ways to not contribute to the problem."

It is really sad, and I hope that things can change top down and bottom up.

I saw in the comments some remarks portraying people who buy at SHEIN like some mindless shopping addicts who lack the common sense to use thrift stores. I'm not sure that's the best way to divert people from fast fashion.

I don't want to shame anyone because I don't think it works and I'd rather talk to them to understand why they buy at SHEIN or similar stores.

I just want to highlight that in the sub there might be some SHEIN buyers, and I do not want to alienate them. If they are here they clearly have an interest in home made stuff and that is great! 

I also want to share with you my experience of buying fast fashion and buying thrift/wearing donated clothes.

I come from a low income backgound. A good portion of my closes were hand me down and were passed latter on to family members. Later on I started visiting thrift shop as well. What I noticed is that both thrifted and donated clothes usually were coming from the traditional fashion or fast fashion industry. They were not necessarily more durable or significantly cheaper than something new. The exception was the one in a million high end quality item, that took hours to find. Because indeed it takes more time to find clothing that fits you, that you like that are in good shape in a thrift store and time is a luxury not everyone has.

I also bought fast fashion item, albeit not at SHEIN, because for a long time I did not have the money to buy anything else. I would go online, easier to spend less money if you don't have to wonder around the shop. I would imput my size, put the lowest prices first and chose the cheapest items I needed at that moment and in 15 minutes my shopping was done! I did not do it to exploit people at the other end of the world. I just did not have other choice to get decently dress for school and work.

I'm sharing my experience not to say that SHEIN is good but to say that some people who buy there don't have any other choice. We all have our blind spots, how many of us use hooks made in China? Or synthetic fibers or cotton with pesticides that are bad for the environment and the people manufacturong those yarns?

Let's have some empathy and try to foster positive changes instead of using.

My comment is not so much about the crochet aspect. I just hope that seeing more crochet in fashion will lead to more people picking up hooks and discovering this craft."

summerhousebravo,Cast Fashion,Paige and her influencer lifestyle fueled by fast fashion,"Hi all! I know we critique Paige a lot for her behavior on SH and also what she wears. I have a background in environmental science (specifically global water policy and scarcity) and wanted to take some time to outline some of the reasons I take such umbrage with Paige's fast fashion influencer platform. I also have a keen interest in fashion, style, design, and the likes. I worked in the fashion industry in PR and retail for several years so have some background in that world.

A few things I should caveat this post with:

1. I know Paige is not alone in peddling fast fashion, especially in the influencer sphere. It's a HUGE problem not just for influencers but also within the larger fashion industry itself.
2. Yes, I have bought things from fast-fashion retailers (and sometimes still do. I try to really limit myself though from turning to them for purchases). I have shopped at H&M, Zara, and Forever21. At one point in time, even working for a luxury fashion retailer, those were the clothes I could afford if I wanted to look stylish. Yes, I was gifted clothes and at times received deep discounts on designer duds but my take-home paycheck wouldn't allow me to purchase any of those items at full price (talk about ironic --> different topic for later!)
3. To point number 2, I understand that we live in a trend-driven consumer market and these retailers are often the only entryway (price-wise) for someone to ""shop the look for less"". There are larger macroeconomic systems at play that make it so that many people resort to these retailers for their clothing options. That point on macro economic environment/systems is obviously a much larger topic so for the sake of this post, I may not touch too deeply on this aspect.
4. I realize that for most of these fast fashion brands if they aren't utilizing Paige as an influencer for them, they will turn to someone else.

Okay, so the meat and potatoes...

Paige's influencing career centered on fast fashion is problematic for me because 1) she centers herself around trends and with the coming and goings of those trends most of this stuff is going to end up in a landfill, 2) fast fashion brands are notorious for their environmental harm and injustice towards low wage workers in developing countries and those adjacent communities, 3) by peddling this stuff to her audience she is engaging in the capitalistic nature of ""buy more stuff"", and 4) she doesn't display any creative and new ways to wear these pieces. It's all just matching sets or IMO really boring looks. I rarely ever see her show off a piece or pieces a second time around (like a ""here's how to wear this multiple ways"").

The biggest violations are really the damages to the environment, which leads to a host of destructive socio-economic burdens and challenges that only further erode/strain the resources of developing nations. The impacts of fast fashion summed up: excessive water usage and pollution, carbon emissions (the industry is responsible for more CO2 emissions than the aviation and maritime shipping industries combined), plastic microfibers, and excessive clothing (57% of all discarded clothing ends up in a landfill).

ETA: As a little conclusion, I'm not demonizing anyone who buys fast fashion, likes what Paige wears, or feels a kinship to her influencer platform. My main point in posting this was just to highlight how she, like many influencers, is entrenched in a vicious cycle of promoting an unsustainable lifestyle with clothes and harmful consumer choices. The impact that her promotions and that the fast fashion industry at large has on our planet have direct ties to many of the socio-economic injustices happening in the global world.

2nd ETA: Thank you to all the folks who gave this post awards. WOW! When I conceived this post, I was literally sitting at home scribbling thoughts on a notepad. I then felt compelled to share these thoughts on Reddit, within this sub.  It's so cool to see the dialogue that's been sparked in the comments.

Paris was sending boxes of tchochkies to people that they would enjoy for the wedding and then throw away. There are going to be hundreds of Paris body pillows in a landfill because she wants to gift already wealthy people a bunch of stuff they will end up throwing away.
summerhousebravo,Cast Fashion,Paige and her influencer lifestyle fueled by fast fashion,"Hi all! I know we critique Paige a lot for her behavior on SH and also what she wears. I have a background in environmental science (specifically global water policy and scarcity) and wanted to take some time to outline some of the reasons I take such umbrage with Paige's fast fashion influencer platform. I also have a keen interest in fashion, style, design, and the likes. I worked in the fashion industry in PR and retail for several years so have some background in that world.

A few things I should caveat this post with:

1. I know Paige is not alone in peddling fast fashion, especially in the influencer sphere. It's a HUGE problem not just for influencers but also within the larger fashion industry itself.
2. Yes, I have bought things from fast-fashion retailers (and sometimes still do. I try to really limit myself though from turning to them for purchases). I have shopped at H&M, Zara, and Forever21. At one point in time, even working for a luxury fashion retailer, those were the clothes I could afford if I wanted to look stylish. Yes, I was gifted clothes and at times received deep discounts on designer duds but my take-home paycheck wouldn't allow me to purchase any of those items at full price (talk about ironic --> different topic for later!)
3. To point number 2, I understand that we live in a trend-driven consumer market and these retailers are often the only entryway (price-wise) for someone to ""shop the look for less"". There are larger macroeconomic systems at play that make it so that many people resort to these retailers for their clothing options. That point on macro economic environment/systems is obviously a much larger topic so for the sake of this post, I may not touch too deeply on this aspect.
4. I realize that for most of these fast fashion brands if they aren't utilizing Paige as an influencer for them, they will turn to someone else.

Okay, so the meat and potatoes...

Paige's influencing career centered on fast fashion is problematic for me because 1) she centers herself around trends and with the coming and goings of those trends most of this stuff is going to end up in a landfill, 2) fast fashion brands are notorious for their environmental harm and injustice towards low wage workers in developing countries and those adjacent communities, 3) by peddling this stuff to her audience she is engaging in the capitalistic nature of ""buy more stuff"", and 4) she doesn't display any creative and new ways to wear these pieces. It's all just matching sets or IMO really boring looks. I rarely ever see her show off a piece or pieces a second time around (like a ""here's how to wear this multiple ways"").

The biggest violations are really the damages to the environment, which leads to a host of destructive socio-economic burdens and challenges that only further erode/strain the resources of developing nations. The impacts of fast fashion summed up: excessive water usage and pollution, carbon emissions (the industry is responsible for more CO2 emissions than the aviation and maritime shipping industries combined), plastic microfibers, and excessive clothing (57% of all discarded clothing ends up in a landfill).

ETA: As a little conclusion, I'm not demonizing anyone who buys fast fashion, likes what Paige wears, or feels a kinship to her influencer platform. My main point in posting this was just to highlight how she, like many influencers, is entrenched in a vicious cycle of promoting an unsustainable lifestyle with clothes and harmful consumer choices. The impact that her promotions and that the fast fashion industry at large has on our planet have direct ties to many of the socio-economic injustices happening in the global world.

HOWEVER, I also strongly believe that in order to truly make an impact and slow climate change, the corporations that contribute to over 70% of GHG emissions need to make major changes. They play an oversized role in climate change while ordinary people are being asked to save the environment. It’s nuanced. Changes need to be made to the way we produce and what we are producing."

summerhousebravo,Cast Fashion,Paige and her influencer lifestyle fueled by fast fashion,"Hi all! I know we critique Paige a lot for her behavior on SH and also what she wears. I have a background in environmental science (specifically global water policy and scarcity) and wanted to take some time to outline some of the reasons I take such umbrage with Paige's fast fashion influencer platform. I also have a keen interest in fashion, style, design, and the likes. I worked in the fashion industry in PR and retail for several years so have some background in that world.

A few things I should caveat this post with:

1. I know Paige is not alone in peddling fast fashion, especially in the influencer sphere. It's a HUGE problem not just for influencers but also within the larger fashion industry itself.
2. Yes, I have bought things from fast-fashion retailers (and sometimes still do. I try to really limit myself though from turning to them for purchases). I have shopped at H&M, Zara, and Forever21. At one point in time, even working for a luxury fashion retailer, those were the clothes I could afford if I wanted to look stylish. Yes, I was gifted clothes and at times received deep discounts on designer duds but my take-home paycheck wouldn't allow me to purchase any of those items at full price (talk about ironic --> different topic for later!)
3. To point number 2, I understand that we live in a trend-driven consumer market and these retailers are often the only entryway (price-wise) for someone to ""shop the look for less"". There are larger macroeconomic systems at play that make it so that many people resort to these retailers for their clothing options. That point on macro economic environment/systems is obviously a much larger topic so for the sake of this post, I may not touch too deeply on this aspect.
4. I realize that for most of these fast fashion brands if they aren't utilizing Paige as an influencer for them, they will turn to someone else.

Okay, so the meat and potatoes...

Paige's influencing career centered on fast fashion is problematic for me because 1) she centers herself around trends and with the coming and goings of those trends most of this stuff is going to end up in a landfill, 2) fast fashion brands are notorious for their environmental harm and injustice towards low wage workers in developing countries and those adjacent communities, 3) by peddling this stuff to her audience she is engaging in the capitalistic nature of ""buy more stuff"", and 4) she doesn't display any creative and new ways to wear these pieces. It's all just matching sets or IMO really boring looks. I rarely ever see her show off a piece or pieces a second time around (like a ""here's how to wear this multiple ways"").

I love when people have thoughtful things to say taken from their own experience. 

I know you kind of dropped this into your caveats, but I think what it always comes down to is the business and what makes you money. Her target market is made up of people that will shop at these brands kind of regardless of influencers. Basically, if Hailey Bieber wears something trendy, I will not buy that same piece. I will probably go to fast, affordable fashion to replicate it. It’s not Hailey Bieber’s fault really, and she didn’t tell me to go buy it. But she did influence me.

I have also noticed a lot of the clothes that Paige doesn’t use to influence or get paid for are actually expensive. So it does just come down to the evil of business and money and capitalism. It’s definitely frustrating, but tbh, I just hate blaming influencers for taking advantage of the business that is there. Especially, when as you said, there is a ton of other factors at play. 

I enjoyed this post and appreciated the time you took to point out the caveats. I took a business ethics class, and we did a case on this. It just ended up feeling like a lose-lose situation."

Okay, so the meat and potatoes...

Paige's influencing career centered on fast fashion is problematic for me because 1) she centers herself around trends and with the coming and goings of those trends most of this stuff is going to end up in a landfill, 2) fast fashion brands are notorious for their environmental harm and injustice towards low wage workers in developing countries and those adjacent communities, 3) by peddling this stuff to her audience she is engaging in the capitalistic nature of ""buy more stuff"", and 4) she doesn't display any creative and new ways to wear these pieces. It's all just matching sets or IMO really boring looks. I rarely ever see her show off a piece or pieces a second time around (like a ""here's how to wear this multiple ways"").

The biggest violations are really the damages to the environment, which leads to a host of destructive socio-economic burdens and challenges that only further erode/strain the resources of developing nations. The impacts of fast fashion summed up: excessive water usage and pollution, carbon emissions (the industry is responsible for more CO2 emissions than the aviation and maritime shipping industries combined), plastic microfibers, and excessive clothing (57% of all discarded clothing ends up in a landfill).

ETA: As a little conclusion, I'm not demonizing anyone who buys fast fashion, likes what Paige wears, or feels a kinship to her influencer platform. My main point in posting this was just to highlight how she, like many influencers, is entrenched in a vicious cycle of promoting an unsustainable lifestyle with clothes and harmful consumer choices. The impact that her promotions and that the fast fashion industry at large has on our planet have direct ties to many of the socio-economic injustices happening in the global world.

Crochet garments are a good reminder for us of the human work that's going into making all our clothes, but absolutely the other clothes are all made by human beings as well. 

If this has sparked your interest, I would highly recommend checking out the Clean Clothes Campaign which supports garment workers' rights. They are often against boycotting brands or clothes from certain companies, unless this is specifically called for by garment workers. There are lots of things you can do to support garment workers' rights which have nothing to do with whether you can afford to avoid any fast fashion brands or only shop from ethical companies. <3"

Our economic standard just doesn't care about people, be they workers or consumers. It's the same with food. It's hard to make a moral/ethical choice if you're starving/have no money."

I understand the outrage because it feels more personal when you understand just how much work crochet is, but it’s kind of ridiculous to post pics at Target saying “This is so wrong!” when anything else you can buy at Target is not any more ethical than the crochet piece. 

The problem is that ethical fashion isn’t accessible to a lot of people- things that might be affordable may not be size-inclusive, and there’s not really a good solution to it. Thrifting/secondhand can be great, but it takes a lot of time and effort to wind up with a cohesive wardrobe. I’m plus-sized and on a budget and no matter how I feel about fast fashion, I still have to clothe my body. I thrift what I can and I wear my clothes until they can’t be worn anymore. 

I won’t be buying fast fashion crochet because not only can I make it myself (but let’s not even start on how wildly unethical the fiber industry is!) but also because those pieces aren’t things I could wear until it’s worn out."

I think the reason we see a lot of people specifically avoiding fast fashion crochet or talking about that on this subreddit is a lot of people here can crochet themselves or family/friends something rather than buying it from Walmart. That is much more within our grasp to avoid, where making our own t-shirts and such is less feasible.

I don't understand why someone realizing via crochet why fast fashion on a whole is bad is a controversial take. No one knows everything and people who have little to no other option but fast fashion may not know how their fast fashion is produced and they are not evil for that. There are more problems in our society than any single person could inherently realize on their own.

It is so hard to source ethical *anything,* especially if you rely on the affordability of fast fashion just to keep you or your family clothed.

I think people here complain about crochet garments specifically because they know that there’s no way to make them quickly or cheaply — it feels more personal because many of us know less about how sewn and knitted garments are made than we do about crochet. We forget (or don’t want to think about) how the labor of operating a machine in a sweatshop is not very different from the labor of hand-crocheting a million granny squares in a sweatshop; both are appalling, but if we haven’t experienced sweatshop conditions ourselves it can be difficult to imagine how terrible it is to be there, so we can fall back on “at least knit sweaters are made on a machine!”"

It’s common knowledge that most crochet stitches cannot be replicated by machines, so any true crochet found in a fast fashion store must be made in sweatshops, which is why there’s been a lot of buzz in the community. Crocheters see crochet in a store and immediately recognize the value of the labour that went into that piece, because we’ve done it ourselves. We might not recognize the value of the labour in any other type of garment or accessory, and that’s a universal problem that does not apply just to crocheters. 

People are uninformed about how their garments are made; even if they know most clothing is made in sweatshops, most people assume that they’re made by machines and that the human labour component must be minimal. The reality is that someone has to be operating the machines, assembling the pieces, etc. There is a human labour component to almost every step of a garment being made in a factory, all of it is valuable, and all of it is paid pennies. 

It’s also important to keep in mind that purchasing sweatshop garments and accessories is unavoidable for the vast majority of us. Crocheters aren’t immune to consumption under capitalism."

But i think the reason why people are making a big deal about crochet is because many items can take weeks to make with crochet compared to normal clothing that uses a sewing machine that can be done way faster than that. Many of the pictures i see on this sub are of granny squares which are more work than something made in one or two pieces because not only do they have to make each square they have to sew each square and weave in the amount of tails which with granny squares is usually a massive amount compared to regular weaving. I personally don't make things with granny squares due to how much more work it is than other crochet items so i can see the outrage people have over someone doing all of that for a small amount of money when someone that is using a sewing machine can make multiples in the time it takes that person to make one and get paid the same. Even if its not the granny squares they are making it still can take a week or two depending on the size so still someone on a sewing machine can make several more in that time frame compared to that one then the person that is crocheting has to make more than one so it likely takes months of their work. Yes those using a sewing machine are definitely being cheated out of money and exploited but as i said someone getting paid the same to make crochet will make way less than the person being paid to sew at a machine due to less being produced in that time frame.

That's why I try to crochet what I need myself or buy textile etc from good sources. It's riduculous that it has to be that time consuming finding it though. It should be the norm not the exeption. And some labels aren't useful in all aspects. For instance I can't remember the last time I saw a fair trade label or something like that on yarn and the fair trade label it self has issues as does other labels. GOTS is great but doesn't ensure fair wages or that slave labour isn't used. EU Ecolabel Clothing and textiles / Textile products is brilliant but supposedly suffers from the same issue. Buying yarn from countries with strong unions can be a way of trying to buy ethically too. But that is not always easy to do. Some european countries like Italy use slave labour a lot in farming for instance despite exporting a lot to countries who prides themself of being modern and democratic.  I would have to do a lot of research to get the good stuff from labels who pays fair wages and sometimes that isn't possible. Countries like the US has a very high tolerance of exploitation, so does lots of other countries. Its a global problem."

I think the more common end result is not ""Oh I feel bad about the environment, I have to buy this 'green' thing to feel better""

It's more like: ""I want to buy new pants and I can't decide between these two from two brands, oh, this one has some stuff about the environment on their site, maybe they care a bit more about that? I'll go with that one""

So it's not that clothing is not the product anymore, it still obviously is. People are buying those clothes to have those clothes. It's that the trash and climate problems have over the years made some 'consoomers' feel justifiably guilty about their shitty buying habits and the greenwashing text boxes and labels make them feel a bit less guilty, so it's a good thing, from a marketing point of view, to add to your product even if it's all lies.

Even if it's all lies, because even if your company is exposed as pretending to be 'green' but being the exact opposite, the only people who care are those who aren't your main customer base anyway and of those that are your most loyal 'consoomers', if they come across the exposure drama, the only 'lesson' they will get from that is ""Oh, so it's difficult to tell the legit 'green' stuff from the bad stuff"" and feel even less guilty of their needless consumption as a result.
